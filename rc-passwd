# This is the Red Carpet Daemon password file.  It allows administrators to
# grant privileges to users to perform various actions on the daemon.
#
# The file is in the format:
#
# username:MD5 hash of password:comma-delimited list of privileges
#
# The default list of privileges is below.  Note that privileges are
# extensible by daemon modules, so if a module registers the "sunshine"
# privilege, it can be granted to users.
#
# none: no privileges
# view: ability to view settings, channels, and system packages
# install: ability to install new packages on the system
# upgrade: ability to upgrade existing packages on the system
# remove: ability to remove existing packages from the system
# superuser: ability to do everything
#
# Note: root always has superuser privileges when accessing locally, so
# unless you plan to grant normal users or remote users privileges on your
# system, you probably don't have to touch this file.
#
# (to get the md5 hash of a password, run 'echo -n <password> | md5sum')
