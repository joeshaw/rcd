General notes
-------------
rcd methods are namespaced, with the convention
"rcd.<namespace>.<method_name>".

If an argument or struct member is optional or conditional, it is
suffixed with the [optional] tag.

For the majority of methods, the return type is specified.  (See more
about types below)  Certain methods, however, always return a single
value (usually 0 or 1).  For those methods, we'll just say the value
that's returned instead of the type.

Each method below has a "Faults" listing.  While some are listed as
"none", every method can return a couple of faults.  If the arguments
to the command are incorrect, a type_mismatch fault (-501) is thrown.
If the method does not exist, an undefined_method fault (-506) is
thrown.  If the calling user cannot be authenticated, a
cant_authenticate (-610) fault is thrown. If the calling user does not
have privileges to execute the command, a permission_denied fault
(-600) is thrown.

A full list of faults is below.

All arguments that are absolute times are in UNIX time format.

rcd also supports the standard XML-RPC method introspection and
multicall APIs.  Look at www.xmlrpc.com for more info.

Types
-----
Most of the types used in this document are the primitive XML-RPC
types.  They include int, bool, string, double, and base64.

In addition, there are compound types for arrays and structs.

An array will be specified in one of two ways:

   array [type]

will indicate a variable-length array which has members of all the
same type.

   (string a1, string a2, int a3)

will indicate a fixed-length array, or an array which has members of
different types.

A struct is just a dictionary; a key-value mapping.  They're specified
as such:

   struct { foo : string, bar : int }

where "foo" and "bar" are the names of the elements.

If a method takes a variable type argument, or the member of an array
or struct is a variable type, we'll use "variable type" as the type
argument.

For simplicity's sake we'll use a few "special" types.  These are
actually structs, but they're such large structs and used so
frequently that we'll just define them one here and use it later on
for things such as "array [package"].

package = struct {
	name : string,
	has_epoch : int,
	epoch : int,
	version : string,
	release : string,
	channel : string,
	importance_num : int [optional],
	importance_str : string [optional],
	license : string [optional],
	package_set : int,
	file_size : int,
	installed_size : int,
	section_str : string,
	section_user_str : string,
	section_num : int,
	channel_guess : string [optional],
	installed : int,
	name_installed : int,
	locked : int }

"channel" is a channel ID.
"license" is a license name.
"package_set" indicates whether this package is a package set.
"channel_guess" is the channel which rcd thinks this package comes
from.  This is for installed packages.
"installed" indicates whether this package is installed.
"name_installed" indicates whether another package with this name is installed.
"locked" indicates whether this package is locked.

package_dep = struct {
	name : string,
	has_epoch : int,
	epoch : int,
	version : string,
	release : string,
	relation : string }

"relation" is the relationship: "(any)", "=", "<", "<=", ">", ">=", "!=".

package_match = struct {
	dep : package_dep,
	glob : string [optional],
	channel : string [optional],
	importance_num : int [optional],
	importance_str : string [optional],
	importance_gteq : int [optional] }

"glob" is an optional package name glob to match.
"channel" is an optional channel to match.
"importance_num" and "importance_str" are optional importances to match.
"importance_gteq" is an optional importance to be greater than or
equal to, to match.

List of faults
--------------
type_mismatch          = -501

	The type expected does not match the type given.  This is
	usually thrown when arguments to a method are incorrect.

invalid_stream_type    = -503
		      
	If the daemon is expecting a certain type for a package search
	and gets a different one (ie, passing in a filename when a
	package structure was expected), this fault will be thrown.

	LAMESPEC: AKA "parse error".  why not just throw type mismatch?

undefined_method       = -506

	This method does not exist on the daemon.

permission_denied      = -600

	The calling user does not have the privileges to execute this
	method.

package_not_found      = -601

	The specified package cannot be found.

package_is_newest      = -602

	Indicates that an installed package is the newest version
	available.  See rcd.packsys.find_latest_version().

failed_dependencies    = -603

	The dependencies for the packages specified should be
	successfully resolved.

invalid_search_type    = -604

	The search type specified is invalid.

invalid_package_file   = -605

	The package file specified is invalid.

invalid_channel        = -606

	The channel specified is invalid.

invalid_transaction_id = -607

	The transaction ID specified is invalid.

invalid_preference     = -608

	The preferenced name specified is invalid.

locked                 = -609

	The transaction lock is held by something else and this
	command could not be executed.  This usually comes up when the
	user tries to run two transactions at the same time, or tries
	to refresh while a transaction is running.

cant_authenticate      = -610

	The daemon cannot authenticate this user (usually over HTTP,
	the username and/or password are incorrect)

cant_refresh           = -611

	The daemon could not successfully refresh the channel data.

no_icon                = -612

	No channel icon is available for this channel (FIXME?)

cant_activate          = -613

	This system could not be activated.

not_supported          = -614

	This feature is not supported by the daemon.

license_not_found      = -615

	The license could not be found.

cant_set_preference    = -616

	The preference could not be set, usually due to an invalid
	value.

invalid_service        = -617

	The specified service is invalid.

transaction_failed     = -618

	A blocking transaction has failed.

Query syntax
------------
rcd has a general query syntax that is used when searching for
packages and transaction logs.  The syntax is:

	 (string key, string type, string query)

where "key" is the token you're matching against, "type" is the type
of match you're doing, and "query" is the data you're matching.

"key" differs depending on what you're searching, so those will be
listed in the individual commands which employ this scheme.  "query"
is the user-specified data.

Below are the different "types":
"is", "eq", "==", "=" (equality)
"is not", "ne", "!="  (not equal)
"contains"	      (substring searches)
"contains_word"	      (word searches)
"!contains"	      (doesn't contain)
"!contains_word"      (doesn't contain word)
">", "gt"	      (greater than)
"<", "lt"	      (less than)
">=", "gteq"	      (greater than or equal to)
"<=", "lteq"	      (less than or equal to)

"begin-or"	      (beginning of an "or" block)
"end-or"	      (end of an "or" block)

Some examples:
[("name", "contains", "foo")]
would match "foo", "foobar", "football"

[("name", "contains_word", "foo")]
would match "foo", but not "foobar" or "football"

[("name", "contains", "foo"), ("name", "contains", "bar")]
would match "foobar", but not "foo" or "football"

[("begin-or", "", ""), ("name", "contains", "bar"),
 ("name", "contains", "ball"), ("end-or", "", "")]
would match "foobar" and "football", but not "foo".

System methods
--------------

rcd.system.protocol_version()

	Returns: int
	Faults: none

 	Instructs clients which protocol version the daemon supports.
        This method was added for rcd 1.4.5, so clients should be
	prepared to handle this if it doesn't exist.  If it doesn't
	exist, the protocol version should be assumed to be 1.  rcd
	1.x uses protocol version 1, and rcd 2.0 uses protocol version
	2.

rcd.system.ping()

	Returns: struct {
		 name : string,
		 copyright : string,
		 major_version : int,
		 minor_version : int,
		 micro_version : int,
		 current_time : int }
	Faults: none

	This method returns information about the running daemon,
	including the name, copyright string, version information,
	and current time.

rcd.system.query_module(string module_name, int required_major,
			int required_minor)

	Returns: bool
	Faults: none

	This method queries the daemon to see if a module by the name
	of "module_name" is installed.  It also checks to see if
	the module's major version is equal to "required_major" and if
	the module's minor version is greater than or equal to
	"required_minor".  When writing modules, generally the major
	number is incremented whenever an incompatible interface
	changes happens (either methods are changed or remoted), and
	the minor number is incremented whenever a forward-compatible
	interface is added (for example, new methods).

rcd.system.poll_pending(int pending_id)
			    
	Returns: struct {
		 id : int,
		 description : string,
		 percent_complete : double,
		 completed_size : int [optional],
		 total_size : int [optional],
		 status : string,
		 is_active : int,
		 elapsed_sec : int [optional],
		 remaining_sec : int [optional],
		 expected_sec : int [optional],
		 start_time : int [optional],
		 last_time : int [optional],
		 error_msg : string [optional],
		 messages : array (string) }
	Faults: none

	Provides information on "pending_id".  A pending ID is
	returned by a few different commands, most notably channel
	refreshing and package transacting, for asynchronous
	operations which can take some time to complete.  "status" is
	one of "pre-begin", "running", "aborted", "failed", or
	"finished".  "is_active" indicates whether the pending is
	still running.  Inactive pendings are cleaned up from time to
	time.  "error_msg" will usually be unset unless the operation
	either failed or was aborted.  "messages" is a variable-length
	array containing useful out-of-band messages.  With package
	transactions, for example, each step ("Downloading foo",
	"Verifying foo", "Installing foo", etc.) is an entry in the
	messages.  Messages are sent with every poll, so it's the
	client's responsibility to keep an index into the array.

	(If "pending_id" isn't a valid pending ID, rcd will return an
	empty struct instead of throwing a fault.)

rcd.system.get_all_pending()

	Returns: array (int)
	Faults: none

	Returns all of the currently active pending ids.

rcd.system.shutdown()

	Returns: 1
	Faults: none

	Shuts down the daemon.

rcd.system.restart()

	Returns: 1
	Faults: none

	Restarts the daemon.

rcd.system.get_recurring()

	Returns: array [struct {
		 label : string,
		 when : int,
		 when_str : string,
		 when_delta : int [optional],
		 prev : int [optional],
		 prev_str : string [optional],
		 prev_delta : int [optional],
		 count : int }]
	Faults: none

	Returns a list of all of the recurring actions in the daemon.
	"when" is an absolute time indicating when this action will
	next run.  "when_str" is a string either in the format
	"Sep 01, 19:25" or "now".  "when_delta" is a relative time
	between the current time and when the action will next run.
	The optional "prev" members indicate when the action most
	recently ran.  "count" is the number of times this action has
	run.

rcd.system.get_cache_size()

	Returns: int
	Faults: none

	Returns the current package cache size in bytes.

rcd.system.flush_cache()

	Returns: 0
	Faults: none

	Flushes the package cache.

Preference methods
------------------
These methods manipulate settings in the daemon.  Here is the list of
default preferences.  Note that not all preferences are available to
all users and that modules can register their own preferences, so the
actual set may be different from this:

Type		Name				Description
string		proxy-url			HTTP proxy URL
string		proxy-username			HTTP proxy username	
string		proxy-password			HTTP proxy password
bool		http-1.0			Use HTTP 1.0 (instead of 1.1)
bool		require-verified-certificates	Verify server SSL certs
bool		cache-enabled			Cache packages and metadata
string		cache-directory			Directory to store cache
bool		cache-cleanup-enabled		Automatically cleanup cache
int		cache-max-age-in-days		Max age for packages in cache
int             cache-max-size-in-mb		Max size for package cache
bool		require-signatures		Require signed packages
int		heartbeat-interval		Seconds between refreshes
int		max-downloads			Max umber of concurrent DLs
int		debug-level			Debug level (0-6)
int		syslog-level			Syslog level (0-6)
bool		remote-enabled			Allow remote clients
int		remote-port			Port to listen on
string		bind-ip				IP address to bind server to
bool		rollback			Enable package rollback

rcd.prefs.list_prefs()

	Returns: array [struct {
		 name : string,
		 description : string,
		 category : string [optional],
		 value : variable type }]
	Faults: none

	This method returns the list of preferences that the user has
	permissions to view.  "value" is the value of the preference
	and can have any of the following types: string, bool, or int.

rcd.prefs.get_pref(string name)

	Returns: variable type
	Faults: none

	Returns the value for the given preference name.  The type is
	one of string, bool, or int.

rcd.prefs_set_pref(string name, variable type value)

	Returns: 0 on success
	Faults: type_mismatch, cant_set_preference, invalid_preference

	Sets the preference specified by "name" to "value".  "value"
	may have one of the following types: string, bool, or int.  If
	the type of "value" does not match the expected type, a
	type_mismatch fault is thrown.  If there is no preference
	named "name", an invalid_preference fault is thrown.  And if
	the preference cannot be set due to an invalid value, a
	cant_set_preference fault is thrown.

Service methods
---------------
A "service" is a description of a server that the daemon contacts to
get channel and package data.

rcd.service.list()

	Returns: array [struct {
		 url : string,
		 name : string,
		 id : string,
		 is_sticky : int,
		 is_invisible : int,
		 is_singleton : int }]
	Faults: none

	Returns a list of the current services on the daemon.

rcd.service.add(string url)

	Returns: 0 on success
	Faults: invalid_service

	Mounts a service based on the URL passed in.  If this fails,
	it will throw an invalid_service fault.  Otherwise the service
	is added and saved to disk.

rcd.service.remove(string identifier)

	Returns: 0 on success
	Faults: invalid_service

	Removes a service based on "identifier".  "identifier" can be
	either the service URL or the service's unique ID.  If this
	fails, it will throw an invalid_service fault.  Otherwise the
	service is removed and saved to disk.

rcd.service.get_mirrors(string identifier)

	Returns: array [struct {
		 name : string,
		 location : string,
		 url : string,
		 ftp : string [optional],
		 contact : string [optional] }]
	Faults: invalid_service

	Lists the mirrors for the given service.  "identifier" can be
	either the service URL or the service's unique ID.  The
	service must be a valid remote service (one that supports
	mirrors), or else an invalid_service fault will be thrown.

	"ftp" is an alternate FTP URL to the data.  Note that rcd does
	not support downloading via FTP currently.  "contact" is an
	email address for the mirror administrator contact.

rcd.service.set_url(string identifier, string new_url)

	Returns: 0 on success
	Faults: invalid_service

	Changes the URL for the given service.  "identifier" can be
	either the service URL or the service's unique ID.  This is
	usually used in tandem with the get_mirrors() method above.
	When the user chooses a new mirror, this method is usually
	called with the mirror's URL.  It will cause the daemon to
	refresh this service.  If the refresh succeeds, the new URL is
	saved to disk and the command returns.  Otherwise, it throws
	an invalid_service fault.

rcd.service.refresh(string identifier [optional])

	Returns: array [int]
	Faults: locked, invalid_service, cant_refresh

	If the optional "identifier" is specified, the channels for
	just that service are refreshed.  Otherwise, all channels for
	all services are refreshed.  If a transaction lock is in
	place, this command will throw the locked fault.  If the
	service specified does not match an existing service, the
	invalid_service fault is thrown.  If the refresh is not
	successful, the cant_refresh fault is thrown.  Otherwise a
	zero or one element array is returned with the pending ID for
	the refresh.  If the array is empty, it means that the refresh
	has already completed.  Otherwise, you must poll on the
	returned ID to see when the refresh finishes.

rcd.service.refresh_blocking(string identifier [optional])

	Returns: 0 on success
	Faults: locked, invalid_service, cant_refresh

	This is a synchronous version of the refresh() method.  The
	difference between the two is that this method will wait until
	the entire refresh is finished and will return 0 unless a
	fault occurs.  See the rcd.service.refresh() method for more
	information.

rcd.service.activate(struct {
		     activation_code : string,
		     email : string,
		     alias : string [optional],
		     service : string [optional] })

	Returns: 0 on success
	Faults: cant_activate, invalid_service

	Activates the daemon against Red Carpet Enterprise and Red
	Carpet Express servers.  If "service" is omitted, there must
	be only one remote service or else activation will fail.
	"alias" is an optional alias for this machine.  If "service"
	is not a valid service, an invalid_service fault will be
	thrown.  If the daemon otherwise can't activate, a
	cant_activate fault will be thrown.

Packaging system methods
------------------------
rcd.packsys.get_channels()

	Returns: array [struct {
		 id : string,
		 name : string,
		 alias : string,
		 subscribed : int,
		 description : string,
		 hidden : int }]
	Faults: none

	Gets the current list of all channels on the system.  If the
	"hidden" element is set, this channel should not be presented
	to the user.

rcd.packsys.get_channel_icon(string channel_id)

	Returns: base64
	Faults: invalid_channel, no_icon

	Returns base64 encoded data of this channel's icon.  If the
	channel ID is not valid, an invalid_channel fault is thrown.
	If this channel has no icon, a no_icon fault is thrown.

rcd.packsys.subscribe(string channel_id)

	Returns: int
	Faults: none

	Subscribes to the channel specified by "channel_id".  Returns
	1 on success, 0 on failure.

rcd.packsys.unsubscribe()

	Returns: int
	Faults: none

	Unsubscribes from the channel specified by "channel_id".
	Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.

rcd.packsys.search(array [(string key, string type, string query)])

	Returns: array [package]
	Faults: invalid_search_type

	Searches for packages meeting the criteria passed in.  See the
	section on query syntax for more info on the parameter syntax.

	Valid query keys:
	"name" - package name

	"summary" - package summary

	"description" - package description

	"text" - name, summary or description

	"channel" - package channel

	"installed" - packages that are installed

	"name-installed" - packages which have a package by this name
	installed

	"package-installed" - an installed package or appears to be
	the in-channel version of an installed package

	"needs_upgrade" - packages which have updates available

	"importance" - update importance

rcd.packsys.search_by_package_match(package_match match)

	Returns: array [package]
	Faults: FIXME

	Searches for packages matching the passed in structure.  This
	is mainly used for looking up packages which match a package
	lock.  If either of the optional elements are not present,
	they are not used in the search.

rcd.packsys.find_package_for_file(string filename)

	Returns: package
	Faults: package_not_found

	Returns the package which contains "filename".  If no package
	is found, a package_not_found fault is thrown.

rcd.packsys.query_file(variable type package_info)

	Returns: package
	Faults: package_not_found, invalid_package, invalid_stream_type

	Returns a package structure based on information passed in as
	"package_info".  "package_info" may either be a string
	indicating a file on the local system, or may be a base64
	encoded package file.  If it is anything else, an
	invalid_stream_type fault is thrown.  If the file does not
	exit, a package_not_found fault is thrown.  If "package_info"
	does not point to a valid package, an invalid_package fault is
	thrown.

rcd.packsys.find_latest_version(string name, bool subscribed_only)

	Returns: package
	Faults: package_is_newest, package_not_found

	Returns the latest package available in a channel for the
	given "name".  If "subscribed_only" is true, then the daemon
	will only look in subscribed channels.  If the latest version
	of the package is already installed, a package_is_newest fault
	is thrown.  If there is no package by that name, a
	package_not_found fault is thrown.

rcd.packsys.package_info(variable type package_info)

	Returns: struct {
		 section : string,
		 file_size : int [optional],
		 installed_size : int [optional],
		 summary : string,
		 description : string }
	Faults: package_not_found, invalid_package, invalid_stream_type

	Gets more in-depth information about a package.
	"package_info" can be any representation of a package: a
	filename on the local system (string), a streamed package file
	(base64), a package (struct), or a package name (string).

	If the package passed in cannot be found, a package_not_found
	fault is thrown.  If the package passed in is not valid, an
	invalid_package fault is thrown.  If the package passed in is
	not a valid package stream type, an invalid_stream_type fault
	is thrown.

rcd.packsys.package_dependency_info(variable type package_info)

	Returns: struct {
		 provides : array [package_dep],
		 requires : array [package_dep],
		 conflicts : array [package_dep],
		 obsoletes : array [package_dep],
		 children : array [package_dep] }
	Faults: package_not_found, invalid_package, invalid_stream_type

	Gets dependency information about a package.  "package_info"
	can be any representation of a package: a filename on the
	local system (string), a streamed package file (base64), a
	package (struct), or a package name (string).

	If the package passed in cannot be found, a package_not_found
	fault is thrown.  If the package passed in is not valid, an
	invalid_package fault is thrown.  If the package passed in is
	not a valid package stream type, an invalid_stream_type fault
	is thrown.

rcd.packsys.file_list(variable type package_info)

	Returns: array [string]
	Faults: package_not_found, invalid_package, invalid_stream_type

	Returns a list of files contained in a package.
	"package_info" can be any representation of a package: a
	filename on the local system (string), a streamed package file
	(base64), a package (struct), or a package name (string).
	Important to note, though, is that package file information is
	not stored in channel packages, so this will only really work
	for system packages, packages from a file, or streamed
	packages.

	If the package passed in cannot be found, a package_not_found
	fault is thrown.  If the package passed in is not valid, an
	invalid_package fault is thrown.  If the package passed in is
	not a valid package stream type, an invalid_stream_type fault
	is thrown.

rcd.packsys.what_provides(package_dep dep)

	Returns: array [(package pkg, struct {
				 name : string,
				 has_epoch : int,
				 epoch : int,
				 version : string,
				 release : string })]
	Faults: none

	Get a list of packages which provide the "dep" dependency
	token.

	LAMESPEC: Why isn't this just a package array.  What's the
	spec for?

rcd.packsys.what_requires()

	Returns: array [(package pkg, struct {
				 name : string,
				 has_epoch : int,
				 epoch : int,
				 version : string,
				 release : string })]
	Faults: none

	Get a list of packages which require the "dep" dependency
	token.

	LAMESPEC: Why isn't this just a package array.  What's the
	spec for?

rcd.packsys.what_conflicts()

	Returns: array [(package pkg, struct {
				 name : string,
				 has_epoch : int,
				 epoch : int,
				 version : string,
				 release : string })]
	Faults: none

	Get a list of packages which conflict with the "dep" dependency
	token.

	LAMESPEC: Why isn't this just a package array.  What's the
	spec for?

rcd.packsys.find_dangling_requires()

	Returns: array [(package pkg, package_dep missing_req)]
	Faults: none

	Returns a list of all packages which have a requirement which
	is not met by some package on the system.  "pkg" is the
	package, and "missing_req" is the requirement that it is
	missing.

rcd.packsys.mount_directory(string path)

	Returns: string
	Faults: none

	Mounts a directory on the local system as a channel, so
	packages can be installed off a local filesystem with full
	dependency analysis.  This will return the channel ID on
	success, or an empty string on failure.

rcd.packsys.unmount_directory(string channel_id)

	Returns: array [(package old_package, package new_package,
		         array [string] history)]
	Faults: none

	This method returns information about available updates.
	Updates only come from subscribed channels.  The "old_package"
	element is the currently installed version of the package.
	The "new_package" is the newest available package from some
	channel, and (FIXME) "history" is a varible length array of
	strings with the update descriptions in all versions between
	"old_package" and "new_package".

		 necessary : int [optional],
		 urgent : int [optional],
		 suggested : int [optional],
		 feature : int [optional],
		 minor : int [optional] }

	Returns: array [package_match]
	Faults: none

	Returns the current list of locks.

rcd.packsys.add_lock(package_match match)

			type : string,
			package : package [optional],
			priority : int,
			package_list : array [package],
			message : string [optional],
			action : string [optional],
			trigger : string [optional],
			is_error : int,
			is_important : int }])
	Faults: package_not_found, invalid_package, failed_dependencies

	Runs the dependency resolver on the provided set of packages
	and additional requirements.  

	If dependency resolution succeeds, the first two arrays
	contain information on additional packages that must be
	installed and removed, respectively.  "operation" is either
	"install" or "remove".  "details" is an array of strings
	indicating additional information about why that package must
	be installed or removed.  The third array contains additional
	dependency resolution info.

	If resolution fails, a failed_dependencies fault is thrown,
	and the text of the fault contains info as to why resolution
	failed.

	LAMESPEC: The third return argument is heavyweight and unused.

rcd.packsys.verify_dependencies()

	Returns: (array [struct {
			operation : string,
			package : package,
			details : array [string] }],

			type : string,
			package : package [optional],
			priority : int,
			package_list : array [package],
			message : string [optional],
			action : string [optional],
			trigger : string [optional],
			is_error : int,
			is_important : int }])
	Faults: failed_dependencies

	Does an internal verification of the dependency tree and
	returns a resolution to correct it.  If the tree cannot be
	fixed, then a failed_dependencies fault is thrown.  After
	doing a transaction with this set, find_dangling_requires()
	should be empty.  For more info on the return values, see
	rcd.packsys.resolve_dependencies().

	LAMESPEC: The third return argument is heavyweight and unused.

rcd.packsys.get_rollback_actions(int when)

	Returns: (array [struct {

	Faults: none

	Returns the list of actions that must be taken to roll back
	the system to the state specified in "when".

		     string client_id, string client_version)

	Returns: (int download_id, int transaction_id, int step_id)
	Faults: none

	Rolls back the system to the state specified in "when".
	"flags" can be 0 (none), 1 (dry run), or 2 (download only).
	"transaction_id" is an ID to log to the server after the
	transaction has finished.  It's only used for Red Carpet
	Enterprise servers.  "client_id" and "client_version" are
	identifiers for determining what client initiated the
	transaction.

	The return value is a fixed-length array of pending IDs that
	can be polled on.  "download_id" is -1 if no packages need to
	be downloaded.  Otherwise it is the overall download
	progress.  "transaction_id" is -1 if the download only flag is
	set.  Otherwise it is the overall transaction progress.
	"step_id" is the progress within a transaction step.  Usually
	this is indicates progress as each individual package is
	installed.

rcd.packsys.rollback_blocking(int when, int flags, string transaction_id,
			      string client_id, string client_version)

	Returns: 0 on success
	Faults: transaction_failed

	Runs a rollback in a blocking fashion, so this method will
	return when the whole transaction has finished.  It will
	return 0 if it succeeds, or throw a transaction_failed fault
	if it fails.  For information on the parameters, see the
	rcd.packsys.rollback() method.

rcd.packsys.transact(array [package] install_packages,

	Returns: (int download_id, int transaction_id, int step_id)
	Faults: none

	Runs a package transaction on the system.  "flags" can be 0
	(none), 1 (dry run), or 2 (download only).  "transaction_id"
	is an ID to log to the server after the transaction has
	finished.  It's only used for Red Carpet Enterprise servers.
	"client_id" and "client_version" are identifiers for
	determining what client initiated the transaction.

	The return value is a fixed-length array of pending IDs that
	can be polled on.  "download_id" is -1 if no packages need to
	be downloaded.  Otherwise it is the overall download
	progress.  "transaction_id" is -1 if the download only flag is
	set.  Otherwise it is the overall transaction progress.
	"step_id" is the progress within a transaction step.  Usually
	this is indicates progress as each individual package is
	installed.

rcd.packsys.transact_blocking(array [package] install_packages,
			      array [package] remove_packages,
		              int flags, string transaction_id,
		              string client_id, string client_version)

	Returns: 0 on success
	Faults: transaction_failed

	Runs a package transaction in a blocking fashion, so this
	method will return when the whole transaction has finished.
	It will return 0 if it succeeds, or throw a transaction_failed
	fault if it fails.  For information on the parameters, see the
	rcd.packsys.transact() method.

rcd.packsys.abort_download(int download_id)

	Returns: 1 on success, 0 on failure.
	Faults: invalid_transaction_id

	Tries to cancel a package download.  "download_id" is the
	download pending ID returned from either the
	rcd.packsys.transact() or rcd.packsys.rollback() methods.  If
	the ID passed in is invalid, an invalid_transaction_id fault
	is thrown.

rcd.packsys.world_sequence_numbers()

	Returns: (int package_seqno, int channel_seqno,
		  int subscription_seqno, int lock_seqno)
	Faults: none

	Returns sequence numbers for various rcd subsystems.  These
	can be used to track whether the current client has the latest
	package, channel, subscription and lock information by polling
	in lieu of a notification mechanism.

rcd.packsys.dump()

	Returns: base64
	Faults: none

	Dumps out all of the information about the daemon, including
	services, channels, packages, locks, and other information
