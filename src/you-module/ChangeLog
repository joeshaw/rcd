	patches with name "patch-*". Yast does not parse version correctly
	for these, so for example, 'patch-9250' will have name 'patch-9250'

	patches to header file so wrapper.cc can use it.

	* wrapper.cc (rc_you_patch_from_yast_patch): Remove some #ifdef'ed
	out code. Don't even try to determine whether the patch is installed,
	it never works correctly. Yay for yast!
	(rc_you_wrapper_install_patches): Make sure patch name AND version
	match before installing a patch. Use rc_debug() instead of g_print().
	(read_installed_patches): Implement. Can't trust PMPatchManager to
	read installed patches so implement out own version which actually

	Set "name_installed" for patches from channels.

	rcd.you.patch_info and rcd.you.licenses for that.

	* wrapper.cc (rc_you_wrapper_get_installed_patches): Assign
	system channel to installed patches.

	* rc-you-transaction.c (rc_you_transaction_get_step_pending):
