	* rc-you-query.[ch]: New files. Implement patch querying,
	similary to package querying.

	* you.c (you_ping): Implement. The gui uses it to figure out
	whether to add patch support.
	(add_patch_cb): Implement.
	(you_search): Rewrite, using RCDQuery.
	(you_list): Remove, you_search does that too.
	(you_transaction): Return pending step too.
	(you_license): Implement.
	(you_info): Implement.
	(rcd_module_load): Rename rcd.you.install to rcd.you.transact.

	* you-util.c (rc_you_patch_to_xmlrpc): Don't send license,
	summary and description fields. Usually noone cares about
	those, and if someone cares, there's new methods
	rcd.you.patch_info and rcd.you.licenses for that.

	* wrapper.cc (rc_you_wrapper_get_installed_patches): Assign
	system channel to installed patches.

	* rc-you-transaction.c (rc_you_transaction_get_step_pending):
	Implement.
	(rc_you_transaction_finalize): Free pending step as well.
	(rc_you_transaction_transaction): Use transaction pending step,
	so in future it could be hooked up to get transaction updates.

	* rc-you-patch.c (rc_you_patch_slist_lookup_licenses): Implement.

	* rc-world-you.c (rc_channel_get_patchinfo_file): Remove hardcoded
	distro target.
	(rc_world_add_patches): Pass system channel to wrapper.

	* Makefile.am (rcd_moduledir): Build rc-you-query.[ch]

	* rc-you-transaction.c (rc_you_transaction_transaction):
	There are no "dry run" patch transactions, I meant "download only".

	* Makefile.am: Install header files for other modules.

	* Initial cvs import.
