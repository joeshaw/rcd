2005-08-15  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transaction.h: Use int instead of GPid. Older versions of glib

	* rcd-transfer.c: Implement retrying.

	* rcd-transfer-http.c (http_done): Fix a compiler warning.

	without warnings.
	(package_dup_fn, channel_dup_fn, rcd_world_remote_dup): Implement.

	dead code.

	* rcd-transfer.c (rcd_transfer_finalize): unref cache entry.
	(rcd_transfer_new): reference cache entry.

	* rcd-transfer-http.c (http_done): Don't just free the protocol
	structure, keep it's free_func() (if provided).

	* rcd-transaction.c (get_packages_to_download): Unref cache entry.
	(fetch_packages): Ditto.

	* rcd-services.c (rcd_services_load): Free the service url if we're

2005-07-19  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* rcd-world-remote.c (saved_target_differs): Free RCBuffer when we're
	done with it.

2005-06-13  michael wolf  <maw@novell.com>

	* rcd-prefs.h
	* rcd-prefs.c: (rcd_prefs_get_filesystem_check_timeout),
	(rcd_prefs_set_filesystem_check_timeout):
	* rcd-rpc-prefs.c:
	* rcd-transaction.c:

	Add a configurable timeout to the stale filesystems hack.  Setting
	to zero disables it.

2005-04-18  James Willcox  <james@ximian.com>

	* rcd-recurring.c: (rcd_recurring_timeout_cb):
	* rcd-transaction.c: (rcd_transaction_transaction):
	* rcd-world-remote.c: (rcd_world_remote_refresh),
	(pending_complete_cb):

	Block recurring events during refresh and transactions	

2005-04-12  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* rcd.c (get_vmsize): Implement (err, steal it from beagle).
	(heartbeat_memory_monitor): Restart if vmsize reaches
	"max-allowed-memory".
	(main): Register heartbeat callback to monitor memory usage.

	* rcd-rpc-prefs.c (rcd_rpc_prefs_register_methods): Register
	"max-allowed-memory" preference.

	* rcd-prefs.h: 
	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_get_max_allowed_memory) Implement.
	(rcd_prefs_set_max_allowed_memory): Implement.

	* rcd-world-remote.c (rcd_world_remote_fetch_channels): Don't connect
	to world's "complete" signal here. We're going to do blocking
	downloading later on so the world can get marked as "refresh done"
	before it's actually done.
	(rcd_world_remote_parse_serviceinfo): Catch the "complete" signal here,
	after all blocking downloads.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (resolve_deps): Don't send detailed resolver info
	to clients. It's a huge amount of data and clients don't use it.

2005-04-05  James Willcox  <james@ximian.com>

	* rcd-recurring.c: (rcd_recurring_timeout_cb):

	Fix the build with gcc4.  Patch from Henne Vogelsang <hvogel@suse.de>

2005-03-11  James Willcox  <james@ximian.com>

	* rcd-buddy.in: write the time of the crash

2005-03-09  James Willcox  <james@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am:
	* rcd-statvfs.c: (main): added
	* rcd-transaction.c: (rcd_transaction_monitor_reap_cb),
	(rcd_transaction_monitor_cb), (rcd_transaction_check_fs),
	(rcd_transaction_verification):
	* rcd-transaction.h:

	Add some machinery for detecting stale nfs volumes, and failing the
	transaction in that case.

2005-02-23  James Willcox  <james@ximian.com>

	* rcd.c: (shutdown_packman): call rc_verification_cleanup() at shutdown

2005-01-27  James Willcox  <james@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transfer-http.c: (http_open):
	* rcd-world-remote.c: (rcd_world_remote_assemble):

	Don't use cached data when assembling a remote world.  This is
	a workaround for a soup bug with auth.  Also, remove the previous
	hack.  (the entry below)

2005-01-20  James Willcox  <james@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transfer-http.c: (http_open):

	Connect to 'reauthenticate' on SoupSession.  This fixes some random
	authentication failures.  Fixes 69508.

2005-01-13  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* rcd-world-remote.c (rcd_extract_packages_from_yum_buffer): Don't
	leak RCDTransfers.
	(rcd_world_remote_fetch): Don't leak RCDTransfer, some minor cleanup.

2005-01-03  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* rcd.c (main): Catch SIGABRT signal so we can print stack trace on
	assert() and abort().

2004-09-02  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_xmlrpc_package_file_list): Free PackageFileSList
	when done with it.

2004-09-01  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transfer-pool.c (rcd_transfer_pool_abort): While aborting running
	transfers, the list can change on each iteration. Handle that.

2004-08-26  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transaction.c (rcd_transaction_transaction): Handle case where
	rc_world_transact() fails but doesn't set packman error. Fixes #63720.

2004-08-25  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_rc_package_from_xmlrpc_package): Free channel_id
	when done with it.

2004-06-19  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-prefs.c (rcd_rpc_prefs_register_methods): Don't require
	superuser privilege to view preferences. The only exception is
	"proxy-password".

2004-06-17  James Willcox  <james@ximian.com>

	* rcd-world-remote.c: (parse_nevra),
	(rcd_extract_packages_from_yum_buffer):

	Don't leak if parsing the yum NEVRA fails.

2004-06-17  James Willcox  <james@ximian.com>

	* rcd-world-remote.c: (parse_nevra), (get_installed_package),
	(rcd_extract_packages_from_yum_buffer),
	(rcd_world_remote_parse_channel_data), (channel_data_file_done_cb),
	(rcd_world_remote_per_channel_cb), (world_check_channel_cb),
	(rcd_world_remote_fetch_channels),
	(rcd_world_remote_parse_serviceinfo):

	Add support for yum repositories.  Also, during refresh we only reload
	channels that have changed, savings loads of bandwidth and cpu time.

2004-06-10  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Add 'you-module' subdir.

2004-04-07  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (dep_get_package_info_cb): Removed most of the
	code, it's already in libredcarpet.

	* rcd-rpc.c (soup_auth_callback): Don't leak the identity.

2004-04-07  James Willcox  <james@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transaction.c: (get_packages_to_download):

        If there are any packages in the transaction with 0 size (like, say,
        packages from apt repos), make the total download size 0 as well.  This
        avoids nasty problems with trying to calculate download progress, etc.

2004-04-01  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* rcd-package-locks.c (rcd_package_locks_load): Fix a leak of the
	xmlDoc.

	* rcd-rpc.c (rcd_rpc_init): Set up a shutdown handler to free the
	XML-RPC registry.

	* rcd-services.c (rcd_services_load): Free the xmlDoc.

2004-03-18  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* rcd-recurring.c (rcd_recurring_setup_timeout): Fix the bug
	where recurring actions got set up wrong if the action time is
	far in the past or future.

2004-02-12  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transfer-http.c (http_open): When checking the proxy URL,
	also check to make sure that the host is not NULL.

2004-02-11  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: Add libsoup libs to link line. These are already in
	RCD_LIBS, but for static linking and circular dependencies, they
	apparently need to be there twice.

	* rcd-shutdown.c (shutdown_idle_cb): Handle execv failures. Fixes
	bug #51716.

2004-02-10  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transfer-http.c (http_done): Get rid of g_idle_add() of
	http_done_real() and move most of the logic back in here.
	(http_open): Defer the actual queuing of the message to an idle,
	since it's also possible that we could get a file data callback
	before http_open() returns as well, and that causes failed
	assertions (#54102) By deferring it, we fix both this and the
	original http_done() issue.  Ref the session and set it in the new
	session field in the protocol structure.
	(http_free): Unref the session.

2004-02-04  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transfer-http.c (http_done_real,
	http_response_not_modified): Move the cache_hit bit to the
	RCDTransfer from the HTTP backend.

	* rcd-world-remote.c (load_package): Remove this, it's replaced by
	prepend_package() and an iteration in
	rcd_world_remote_parse_channel_data().
	(rcd_world_remote_per_channel_cb): Fix a typo where icon downloads
	were being reported as "package data" and not "package icon".
	Should make download debug logs more clear.

2004-02-04  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

       * rcd-world-remote.c (rcd_world_remote_parse_channel_data):
       Sort packages according to arch compat and other bits before
       trying to insert them into the rc_world_store, as inserting
       a "better" package is an expensive operation.

2004-01-29  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc.c (rcd_rpc_remote_server_start): Create a SoupAddress
	from the bind_ip setting and resolve it before passing it into
	soup_server_new().  Fixes #53471.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_get_channel_icon): Fix a few
	instances where "%d" was used instead of "%s" for channel ids.

2004-01-20  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transfer-file.c (file_open): If we get an invalid URI, set
	that error and return -1.

	* rcd-transfer-http.c (http_done): Defer as much processing as we
	can to an idle function that runs the next time we hit the main
	loop, since this could get called from inside
	rcd_transfer_begin().
	(http_done_real): Move the work here.  Also check to make sure
	that rcd_transfer_begin() doesn't return -1, or else we know that
	trying to load from the cache failed.

	* rcd-transfer.c (rcd_transfer_begin): Undo the nastiness of
	handling the possibility of rcd_transfer_file_done() being called
	from the protocol's open function, since it causes lots more
	problems than just a missed ref.  It's handled in the HTTP backend
	now by deferring to an idle handler.

2004-01-13  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_get_proxy): Nuke this function, it's not
	used anymore.
	(rcd_prefs_get_required_verified_certificates,
	rcd_prefs_set_require_verified_certificaqtes): Don't bother
	calling soup_set_ssl_ca_file(), we do that in RCDTransfer now.

	* rcd-rpc.c: Update for new libsoup APIs.  Replace all occurances
	of soup_message_set_error() with soup_message_set_status().
	(soup_rpc_callback): Don't free method_data->host, it's const now.
	(rcd_rpc_remote_server_start): Don't call
	soup_set_ssl_cert_files(), they get passed to the soup server's
	constructor.  Replace occurances of soup_server_register() with
	soup_server_add_handler(), replace soup_server_unref() with
	g_object_unref().

	* rcd-transfer-http.c: Remove a bunch of overlapping #defines.
	Update for new libsoup 2.2 APIs.
	(http_authenticate): Added.  Handles the "authenticate" signal
	from the SoupSession, sets the username and password to the mid
	and secret if we're doing digest authentication.
	(http_message_restarted): Added.  Flushes the data from the
	message, which we need to do on messages that are requeued (auth
	challenges and redirects).
	(http_open): Create the session if it doesn't exist, create a
	message from the session.  Use the new libsoup APIs for setting
	the proxy and the SSL CA if we're requiring verified certs.
	Connect to the authenticate and restarted signals.  Send the
	request as mime type "application/data".

	* rcd-transfer.c (rcd_transfer_get_protocol_from_url): Update to
	check GQuarks instead of enum values, since the protocol field
	changed in SoupUri.
	(rcd_transfer_begin): Take a ref on the transfer much earlier than
	before, since calling the protocol's open method might result in a
	synchronous call to rcd_transfer_file_done(), which releases this
	ref.

	* rcd-xmlrpc.c: Port this to using RCDTransfer from using libsoup
	directly.
	(send_request): Renamed from do_soup_request().  Set up an
	RCDTransfer (without caching and pending info), make sure that
	it's HTTP, set the HTTP method to POST, set the body to the
	XML-RPC data, and make a blocking call.  Return the returned data.
	(send_request_async): Renamed from do_soup_request_async().
	Create a transfer withouot caching, pending info, or buffering of
	data, ensure that it's HTTP, set the HTTP method to POST, set the
	body to the XML-RPC data, conncet to the "file_done" signal, and
	begin the transfer.
	(file_done_cb): Set the fault to the transfer error, if any, and
	call the user's callback.

	* rcd.c (main): Call g_thread_init() since libsoup needs it, don't
	set up the SSL CA stuff since it's done per-transfer now.

2003-12-16  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* rcd-services.c (rcd_services_load): Always load system and synthetic
	packages. Don't add network services if running with --no-network.

2003-12-15  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_get_rollback_actions): Use xmlrpc_int32
	instead of time_t when parsing xmlrpc value.
	(setup_rollback): Ditto.

2003-12-03  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-world-remote.c (rcd_world_remote_fetch_channels): Don't call
	rc_world_refresh_complete() on channel data download error, since
	it's already called in rcd_world_remote_refresh().  Fixes a failed
	assertion.

2003-11-20  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* rcd-services.c (rcd_services_load): Don't load services when
	running with '--no-services'.
	(rcd_services_save): Don't save services when running with
	'--no-services'.

	* rcd-options.c (rcd_options_parse): Add '--no-services' flag...
	(rcd_options_get_no_services_flag): ... and make it available for
	others.

2003-11-14  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transaction.c (format_size): Cast the file size to long to
	avoid a warning on 64-bit archs where longs are 64 bits and gsize
	is a long.

	* rcd-world-remote.c (rcd_world_remote_fetch_distributions,
	rcd_world_remote_fetch_licenses, rcd_world_remote_fetch_news,
	rcd_world_remote_fetch_mirrors, saved_target_differs,
	rcd_world_remote_fetch_channels): Instead of checking to see
	if the mmapped RCBuffer is NULL, check if buffer is NULL,
	since it's valid to have a non-NULL RCBuffer but with a NULL
	data portion (ie, a 0 byte file). 

2003-11-13  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-prefs.c (get_boolean_func, get_int_func,
	set_boolean_func, set_int_func): Use the glib integer/pointer
	conversion macros for 64 bit cleanliness.

	* rcd-unix-server.c (read_data): Fix "int" to "gsize" for sizes
	passed into g_io_channel_{read_write} so that things work nicely
	on 64 bit archs.

2003-11-06  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transfer-http.c (http_info): Reset the file_size, in case we
	get a Content-Length in a 30x, 401 or 407 and then don't get one
	in the subsequent response.

	* rcd-world-remote.c (rcd_world_remote_refresh): Ignore the error
	coming back from rcd_world_remote_fetch().  If the pending is
	NULL, call rc_world_refresh_complete().
	(rcd_world_remote_parse_serviceinfo): If we get an error calling
	rcd_world_remote_fetch_channels(), free the error instead of
	propagating it up, since not being able to get the channel list
	shouldn't be a fatal error when adding a service.

2003-10-31  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-world-remote.c (rcd_world_remote_finalize): Don't free the
	identity stuff here.
	(lookup_identity, foreach_identity): Get rid of these, they've
	been moved to the module.
	(rcd_world_remote_init): Don't create the identity backend.

2003-10-30  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd.c (shutdown_world): Remove some debugging spew for the
	release.

2003-10-29  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-options.c (rcd_options_get_config_file): If the config file
	isn't absolute, make it so.

2003-10-29  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* rcd-heartbeat.c (rcd_heartbeat_start): Decrease debug level.

	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_set_heartbeat_interval): Fix a typo.

2003-10-28  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_rc_package_dep_to_xmlrpc): Marshal the
	channel dep into the XML-RPC struct.
	(rcd_xmlrpc_to_rc_package_dep): Get the channel id from the XML-RPC
	struct and get a channel for it to pass into
	rc_package_dep_new_from_spec().

2003-10-27  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_add_lock): Don't try to use xmlrpc_env
	if it's fault is already set, it asserts.

2003-10-23  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_xmlrpc_to_rc_package_match): Add
	XMLRPC_FAIL_IF_FAULT() after calls to xmlrpc_struct_has_key() so
	that we don't get failed assertions if we get something we weren't
	expecting.

2003-10-21  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transaction.c (transact_step_cb): Print out the action
	during the transaction step.

2003-10-20  Joe Shaw  <joe@Ximian.com>

	* rcd-world-remote.c (rcd_world_remote_parse_channel_data): Return
	a gboolean indicating success.  If rc_uncompress_memory() returns
	< 0, return FALSE.  If we don't understand the channel type, set
	the count to -1 instead of 0.  Return TRUE if the count is >= 0.
	(rcd_world_remote_per_channel_cb): If we're loading cached data
	off the disk and rcd_world_remote_parse_channel_data() fails, set
	need_download to TRUE so we'll get it off the network (and hope
	that it's good).

2003-10-20  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-cache.c (rcd_cache_lookup_entry): Change the
	add_base_on_cache_miss argument to return_base_on_cache_miss.
	Don't insert the base entry into the hash_table, since that's done
	when the transfer is successfully completed.

	* rcd-transfer-http.c: Remove the RCDCacheEntry field from the
	RCDTransferPotocolHTTP struct and just use the cache_entry field
	on the RCDTransfer object throughout instead.  Whee, 4 byte savings.

2003-10-16  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-prefs.c: Make rcd_prefs_error_quark() and RCD_PREFS_ERROR
	public so modules can use them.

2003-10-15  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-service.c (add_service_cb): Don't send distro info if the
	distro isn't set.

	* rcd-world-remote.c (rcd_world_remote_refresh): Pass in a GError
	to rcd_world_remote_fetch(), and if it comes back non-NULL, call
	rc_world_refresh_complete() to indicate that we're finished
	refreshing that world.  (Otherwise it'll be called after we've
	successfully finished download package data)
	(rcd_world_remote_fetch): Remove the call to
	rc_world_refresh_complete() in just one failure case.  Moving it
	up to rcd_world_remote_refresh() catches all cases.

2003-10-14  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-world-remote.c (rcd_world_remote_assemble): Validate the URL
	and set and error and return FALSE if it doesn't.

2003-10-08  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd.c (daemonize): Remove /var/lock/subsys/rcd on shutdown so
	that /sbin/service rcd status doesn't report "subsys locked" when
	you do a "rug shutdown".

2003-10-07  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-cache.c (rcd_cache_entry_open): Check to make sure that the
	cache path is absolute before trying to open it.
	(rcd_cache_entry_is_open): Added.
	(rcd_cache_entry_append): Fix a broken assertion.

	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_set_cache_dir): Set an error if the cache
	directory is not an absolute path.

	* rcd-transaction.c (check_download_space): If the path isn't
	absolute, set an error and fail the transaction.  If the statvfs()
	call fails, set an error or else we'll segfault.

	* rcd-transfer-http.c (http_done, http_read_data): Check to make
	sure the cache entry is open before trying to append data to it or
	closing it... this fixes some failed assertions.

	* rcd-world-remote.c (save_target): Check to make sure the entry
	is open before writing to it and closing it.

2003-10-06  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-unix-server.c (rcd_unix_server_run_async): When we mkdir()
	the socket directory, our permissions can get umasked off, so we
	need to explicitly chmod it after the fact.

2003-10-03  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transaction.c (rcd_transaction_begin): Move the call to
	get_packages_to_download() from rcd_transaction_download() to
	here, so that when things call
	rcd_transaction_get_download_pending() they don't get NULL.

2003-10-03  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transaction.c (rcd_transaction_begin): Defer actual
	execution of the transaction so we can immediately return info to
	clients by putting it in an idle handler.

	* rcd-package-locks.c (rcd_package_locks_load): Don't pass the
	world into rc_package_match_from_xml_node() anymore.

2003-10-02  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-recurring.c (rcd_recurring_execute): Wrap the recurring's
	execute() method in a rcd_recurring_block()/allow() to prevent
	reentrancy while a recurring executes.

	* rcd-world-remote.c: Bah, fix a bunch of warnings which only show
	up when building with gcc at -O2.  It should know better...

2003-10-01  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-world-remote.c (rcd_world_remote_fetch): After we free
	tmp_error, reassign NULL to it.  After we invalidate the cache
	entry, create a new one since we're going to pass it into
	rcd_transfer_new() next.

2003-10-01  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc.c (rcd_rpc_remote_server_start): Change the error
	message to avoid a double-negative.

	* rcd-world-remote.c (rcd_world_remote_fetch_channels): Mention
	that the channels are for all targets in the debug message,
	because I forgot.

2003-09-30  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-recurring.c (rcd_recurring_execute): If the next event is
	scheduled to occur at some point in the past, get the next event
	in terms of the current time, instead.

2003-09-29  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* rcd-xmlrpc.c (rcd_xmlrpc_foreach_cb): Free server_info when done.

2003-09-29  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-prefs.c (prefs_set_pref): Free the GError after we set a
	fault with it.  Found by Tambet.

	* rcd-world-remote.c: Since the move to channel base IDs, it's
	possible to get old cached data even if the target changes.  This
	commit fixes that by saving the old target to disk and when
	refreshing checking to see if the detected target is different
	from the one on disk.  This is all Jose's fault.
	(rcd_world_remote_fetch_channels): Add a huge comment describing
	the problem and call some helper functions to see if the target is
	different and to save it if it is.
	(saved_target_differs, save_target): Added.  Uses the rcd-cache
	methods to check and save this data.
	(rcd_world_remote_per_channel_cb): If the "flush" flag was set
	(because the target changed), invalidate channel data and icon
	cache entries so we ensure that we download them.
	(build_register_params): Fix a cut-and-paste error... the server
	port should be sent as an int, not a string.

2003-09-29  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* rcd-world-remote.c (build_register_params): Send port number
	along with activation.

2003-09-29  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transaction.c: It's no longer sufficient to assume that the
	system packages won't have changed between transaction-time and
	logging-time (in fact, they always change immediately after
	transaction now), so we need to cache the old packages so we can
	determine if something was an install or an upgrade.
	(rcd_transaction_finalize): Destroy the old package hash.
	(rcd_transaction_finished_handler): Don't need to bother sync'ing
	the world.
	(update_log): Look up the old package in the old package hash, not
	on the world.
	(save_old_packages): Added.  Builds the old package hash from
	system packages before the transaction.
	(rcd_transaction_transaction): Call save_old_packages() before
	running the transaction.

2003-09-26  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-world-remote.c (rcd_world_remote_activate): Get a string as
	the return value from rcserver.activate(), which if not empty
	indicates our new server URL.  If provided, set our service URL to
	that and refresh.

2003-09-26  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-world-remote.c: Add an "activated" signal for when the
	RCDWorldRemote successfully activates against an RCE server.

2003-09-26  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-world-remote.c (rcd_world_remote_parse_serviceinfo): Don't
	download privileges in here anymore.  It'll be handed by a module.

2003-09-25  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_set_*): Make the non-generic set
	functions take a GError so we can pass good error messages back to
	clients.

	* rcd-rpc-prefs.c (prefs_set_pref): Pass in a GError to the set
	function and if it fails, append the error message to the fault
	string.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (synth_package_from_update): Don't reset the
	channel, we'll need it later.

2003-09-25  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am (rcdinclude_HEADERS): Make rcd-transaction.h public.

2003-09-24  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd.c (main): Don't set up a shutdown handler to do
	g_main_loop_quit(), since we don't guarantee order and therefore
	might never get to the code which does the daemon restart.  Set up
	a g_assert_not_reached() if we get to the end of main(), since
	rcd-shutdown.c should handle exiting out for us.

2003-09-23  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transaction.c (rcd_transaction_set_rollback): Implement.
	(transaction_xml): Send transaction's rollback, dry run, and
	prepostion information.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (setup_rollback): Set new transaction type
	to rollback.

	* rcd-transaction.c (transaction_xml): Change "endtime" type to
	integer from float. For some mysterious reason float wasn't good
	enough.

2003-09-19  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc.c (rcd_rpc_call_method): Set xmlrpc preinvoke method
	so it gets right RCDIdentity.

2003-09-18  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_mount_directory): Check for faults
	after parsing arguments, otherwise we assert later.

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_rc_channel_to_xmlrpc): If the channel is in
	a locally mounted directory, set the mounted bit.

2003-09-18  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_rc_channel_to_xmlrpc): Include the service
	id in the channel structure if there is one.

	* rcd-rpc.c (soup_rpc_callback, soup_default_callback,
	soup_auth_callback): Set the Server header to
	"Red Carpet Daemon/VERSION"

	* rcd-transaction.c (manifest_xml_node): #if 0 out an unused
	variable so we compile -Werror.

2003-09-17  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_find_package_for_file): Update to
	accept multiple packages from the return of
	rc_packman_find_file().
	(packsys_search, packsys_search_by_package_match,
	packsys_package_info, packsys_package_dependency_info,
	packsys_file_list, setup_transaction): Call g_slist_free() on
	various RCPackageSLists that were being unreffed.

	with it.

2003-09-16  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-world-remote.c (rcd_world_remote_fetch): Get
	serviceinfo.xml, not .gz.

2003-09-16  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	(transaction_xml): Ditto.

2003-09-15  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-prefs.c (set_boolean_func): Allow string values for
	boolean prefs.  "1", "true", "yes", "on" are acceptable for truth
	and "0", "false", "no", and "off" for untruth.
	(set_int_func): Allow string values for integer prefs.  If any
	character in the string can't be converted to an int, throw a type
	mismatch fault.

	* rcd-rpc-util.h: Add RCD_RPC_FAULT_TYPE_MISTMATCH (-501).

	* rcd-world-remote.c (rcd_world_remote_assemble): Don't free the
	service url and then replace it until after we're done with the
	query_part, which is a substring of the service url.

2003-09-15  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-world-remote.c (rcd_world_remote_assemble): Check 13 bytes,
	not 15.
	(rcd_world_remote_fetch_channels): If the channel data fails,
	short circuit to the cleanup label.  Remove a comment which no
	longer applies.
	(rcd_world_remote_fetch): If we get an error we'll need to call
	rc_world_refresh_complete() or else the refresh will hang.

2003-09-12  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc.[ch] (rcd_rpc_get_xmlrpc_registry): Remove. There's no
	reason to export this anymore.

2003-09-11  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-xmlrpc.c (soup_request_done): Don't check for a fault
	immediately after parsing the response, since we need to pass that
	fault into the callback.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_mount_directory): Add a recursive
	flag to the mount_directory RPC method.

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_rpc_block_on_pending_list): Make the pending
	check a timeout instead of an idle so we don't hit the main loop
	excessively and wedge at 100% CPU on a transact_blocking() call.
	Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it!  (see
	commit on 2003-06-26)

2003-09-11  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc.c (rcd_rpc_call_method): Implement. A wrapper around

	items which are marked for removal.

	* rcd-world-remote.c (rcd_world_remote_refresh): Call
	rc_world_refresh_begin() before going to rcd_world_remote_fetch().

	* rcd-transfer-http.c: Replace rc_auth_header with a hash table
	rc_auth_header_table which caches X-RC-Auth per-host instead of
	globally.

2003-09-09  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_mount_directory): Throw a fault with
	the GError message if a directory can't be mounted.

	* rcd-rpc-service.c (add_service_cb): Add a bunch of additional
	service info to be sent down to clients.
	(service_add): Pass in a GError to rc_world_multi_mount_service()
	and pass the error message into the XML-RPC fault if it fails.

	* rcd-services.c (rcd_services_load): Update for service GErrors.

	* rcd-world-remote.c (rcd_world_remote_refresh): Get rid of the
	RCD_WORLD_REMOTE_FETCH_FAILED crap
	(rcd_world_remote_assemble): Take a GError argument and pass it

	before dereferencing it.
	(rcd_world_remote_fetch_channels): Take a GError argument and set
	it if downloading the channel list fails.
	(rcd_world_remote_parse_serviceinfo): Take a GError argument and
	set it if parsing the serviceinfo.xml.gz file fails, if the
	distribution type can't be determined or is unsupported.  Don't
	fetch privileges if downloading the channel list failed.
	(rcd_world_remote_fetch): Take a GError argument and pass it into
	rcd_world_remote_parse_serviceinfo().  If we fail loading the
	serviceinfo off disk, invalidate the cache.  If we're downloading
	it and it fails, set the GError to the transfer error.  If we
	can't parse the downloaded data, invalidate the cache and
	propagate the error.

2003-09-09  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-world-remote.c (channel_data_file_done_cb): Don't try to
	parse the transfer buffer as channel data if the transfer failed,
	it'll probably just be useless HTML then.

2003-09-08  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-identity.c: Virtualized the identity checking functions, so
	that we can get privileges from an RCE server in addition to the
	normal rcd.passwd file.
	(rcd_identity_foreach_from_password_file,
	rcd_identity_from_password_file,
	rcd_identity_update_password_file,
	rcd_identity_remove_from_password_file): Make these functions

	(rcd_identity_update): Add or update an identity
	(rcd_identity_remove): Remove an identity.

	* rcd-rpc-users.c (users_get_all): Use rcd_identity_foreach()
	instead of rcd_identity_foreach_from_password_file().
	(users_update): Use rcd_identity_update() instead of
	rcd_identity_update_password_file().
	(users_remove): Use rcd_identity_remove() instead of
	rcd_identity_remove_from_password_file().

	* rcd-rpc.c (unix_rpc_callback, soup_rpc_callback,
	soup_auth_callback): Use rcd_identity_lookup() instead of
	rcd_identity_from_password_file().

	* rcd-world-remote.c (rcd_world_remote_fetch_channels): Clear out
	the old channel and package data before refreshing.
	(rcd_world_remote_fetch_privileges): If we're on an RCE server,
	make a call to the server to get a list of privileges.

	premium_service is set.

2003-09-05  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (resolve_deps): Check the RC_DEPS_TIME

	argument, which is struct now.

	* rcd-rpc-service.c (service_activate): "email" key in arguments
	struct is optional.

2003-09-04  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c: Move heartbeat refreshing out of this file...

	* rcd-rpc-service.c: ... and into this one, with the rest of the
	refreshing code.

	* rcd-transaction.c (fetch_packages): Moved here from rcd-fetch.c.

	* rcd-world-remote.c (rcd_world_remote_activate): Added, formerly

	so that we can break compatibility and avoid nasty tracebacks.
	(rcd_rpc_system_register_methods): Register the method.

	* rcd-rpc-service.c (service_add): Add the "remote_only=1" query
	string to the service URL so that we always load service data off
	the net after a "rug service-add".

	* rcd-world-remote.c (rcd_world_remote_assemble): Parse the URL
	with the query string.
	(rcd_world_remote_fetch_distributions,
	rcd_world_remote_fetch_licenses, rcd_world_remote_fetch_news,
	rcd_world_remote_fetch_mirrors): Add a local flag to all of these
	so that they're loaded off disk when rcd starts up if possible.

2003-08-28  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c: Move the blocking RPC call and channel
	refresh stuff out of here.  Update for changes in the
	rcd-transaction pending API.

	* rcd-rpc-service.c: Move the channel refresh stuff into here.
	RPC method changed to rcd.service.refresh(), and takes an optional
	service name.

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_rpc_block_on_pending_list): Added.  The
	blocking RPC call stuff moved here and opaquified.

	* rcd-transaction.c (rcd_transaction_download): Remove two dubious
	lines of code which didn't appear to have any useful effect and
	had no clever comment justifying their existence.

	* rcd-cache.c (normal_cache_base_dir_func): Put the data in the
	toplevel cache directory.
	(package_cache_filename_func): Just use the filename, don't bother
	with the host, as the packages will probably be the same if there
	is a name conflict.

	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_get_cache_dir): Change the default cache
	directory to /var/cache/rcd.

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_rc_package_to_xmlrpc): Change the package
	set flag to "package_set" from "is_package_set" to match up with
	the packageinfo.xml.gz tag.

	* rcd-world-remote.c (rcd_world_remote_fetch): Store the service
	info in the service_info cache directory instead of per-url.

2003-08-27  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* rcd-xmlrpc.c (xmlrpc_server_info_set_auth): g_free is smart
	enough to handle NULLs. Change the format of password so things
	work.

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_register): 
	(register_cb): Make activations work, don't leak memory.

	* rcd-transaction.c (rcd_transaction_finalize): Free transaction id.

	RCD_WORLD_REMOTE_FETCH_FAILED, return NULL.
	(rcd_world_remote_fetch): Download serviceinfo.xml.gz instead of
	channels.xml.gz.  If loading the cached data fails, go out and
	download it again.  Call rcd_world_remote_parse_serviceinfo().
	(extract_service_info): Get the "channels_file" attribute, which
	points to the corresponding channels.xml.gz file.  Instead of just
	storing the filenames and then building the URLs at request time,
	build them here, ahead of time.
	(rcd_world_remote_parse_serviceinfo): Added.  Parses out the
	service info and then fires off transfers for things like
	channels, licenses, news, mirrors, and distro info.
	(rcd_world_remote_fetch_channels): Added.  Downloads and parses
	the channels.xml.gz file.

	* rcd-xmlrpc.c (soup_request_done): Call callback only if it's
	set.
	(rcd_xmlrpc_client_foreach_host): New function. We just need
	to send information to all (premium) hosts all the time. This
	should make it a bit easier and more convenient.
	(rcd_xmlrpc_foreach_cb): Real work happens here.

	* rcd-transaction.h: Add id to transaction class.

	services list after an unmount.
	
2003-08-18  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-news.c (foreach_subworld_cb): Use the new

	(rcd_options_get_download_distro_flag): Added.
	(rcd_options_reset_*): Added.  Resets the command-line options for
	when the user uses a pref to change the operation of the running
	daemon.

	the key.
	(rcd_prefs_set_*): Make these return a gboolean indicating success

	SoupServer so it can be properly stopped.  Return a boolean
	indicating success.
	(rcd_rpc_remote_server_stop): And stop it here.
	(rcd_rpc_init): Add a shutdown handler for the remote server here
	(if running) instead of in rcd_rpc_remote_server_start().

	* rcd-shutdown.c (do_shutdown): A little more debugging info.

	* rcd.c (initialize_rc_world): Wrap the call to
	rc_world_get_system_packages() with some rc_debug() so it's easier
	to pinpoint when rpmlib hangs due to a stale lock.
	(load_distro_info): Added.  Either downloads the distro info and
	loads it (if -d is set) or just loads the internal data.
	(main): Don't initialize data until after the RPC server has
	started, so we can start listening to requests immediately.  Fixes
	#44413, #43880.  Also always start the local server but only start

	heartbeats.
	(rcd_rpc_queue_is_empty, rcd_rpc_queue_push, rcd_rpc_queue_pop):

	method is commented out pending an xmlrpc-c patch.
	(rcd_rpc_init): Add a heartbeat function to flush the queue.
	(pop_queue_cb): Flush the method queue.

2003-05-27  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc.c (rcd_rpc_init): Bump up the XML-RPC size limit from 2
	megs to 10 megs.  (Fixes #43640)

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_refresh): Refresh transient channels on
	the real world, not our temporary world.  (Fixes #43734)

2003-05-23  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_transact): Clean up and make it use
	the new RCDTransaction API permanently.  Unref the transaction
	object when we're through with it.

	* rcd-transaction.c (rcd_transaction_started_handler): Ref
	ourselves so users can safely unref the transaction object after
	they're done and have it get cleaned up automatically.
	(rcd_transaction_finished_handler): Clean up the cache after the
	transaction if caching is off and we're not in download-only
	mode.  Unref ourselves.

	there were still queued up transfers and a running one died or was
	cancelled then the transfer pool would never be failed and would
	hang.

2003-05-23  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-fetch.c (get_mirrors_url): Fix a FIXME in which the daemon
	was always trying to download mirrors.xml from

	* rcd-autopull.c: Comment out the rcd-transaction calls.

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_channel_local): rc_map_file()

	argument instead of creating one and returning it.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_transaction): Use refactored
	RCDTransaction API, comment out the old ones.

	* rcd-transaction.c: Refactor this pretty heavily.  Make an
	RCDTransaction a GObject and expose it publicly.  Get rid of most
	of the arguments to rcd_transaction_begin() and put them in their
	own functions.  Break up the steps of the transaction a little
	more discretely and add transaction_started and
	transaction_finished signals so we can more easily have code which
	runs no matter what.  Still needs work: logging is completely
	disabled, as is cancelling the download, and all the code is still
	there, just #if 0'ed out.

2003-05-20  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am (rcdinclude_HEADERS): Added rcd-rpc-util.h

2003-05-16  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	failure.  Also remove some unncessary indenting.

2003-05-14  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_rc_package_to_xmlrpc): Set an

	and decompress it here.

2003-04-30  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_file_list): Added.  An RPC method
	which gets the list of files out of an RCPackage.
	(rcd_rpc_packsys_register_methods): Register the RPC method.

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_xmlrpc_package_file_list): Added.  Does the
	heavy lifting in converting the filenames from a package's file
	list to an xmlrpc array.

	channel list, data, and icons as well as news and mirrors.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_refresh_all_channels): Call
	rcd_fetch_refresh().
	(rcd_rpc_packsys_register_methods): Call rcd_fetch_refresh() as
	the heartbeat func.

	* rcd.c (rehash_data): On SIGHUP we might as well just refresh the
	data.  Call rcd_fetch_refresh() instead of recalling
	initialize_data() and possibly breaking things.

2003-04-22  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_rc_package_to_xmlrpc): Serialize the

	to the struct.
	(rcd_transaction_status_unref): Unref it.

	rcd_fetch_packages_abort().

	* rcd-transfer-pool.[ch]: Added.  Implements an accumulator for

	cancel the whole pool of downloads if one fails or is aborted.

	* rcd-transfer.c (error_to_string): Rename this to
	rcd_transfer_error_to_string() and make it public.

	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_get_required_certificates): Also set the
	soup SSL CA file here, as the setting may have changed underneath
	us in the rcd.conf file.  Fixes #41003.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c: Nuke refresh_channels_cb() and just cast and
	call refresh_all_channels() as the heartbeat function directly.
	Should also fix a crash on heartbeat.

2003-04-08  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-autopull.c (rcd_autopull_fetch_channel_list): Update for
	rcd_fetch_channel_list() parameter change.

	* rcd.c (initialize_data): Ditto.

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_register): Always initialize err_msg to
	NULL if passed in a valid address.
	(rcd_fetch_channel_list): Added an out "err_msg" parameter which
	will contain an error string if downloading the channel list
	fails.  Also check that we're on a supported distribution here.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (refresh_all_channels): Added.  Most of
	refresh_channels_cb() was moved here, and it has a saner API.
	(refresh_channels_cb): Make this mostly a wrapper around
	refresh_all_channels().
	(packsys_refresh_all_channels): Call refresh_all_channels()
	instead of refresh_channels_cb().  Pass the error message through
	the fault so the user can see it.

2003-04-08  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: Add rcd-license.[ch], rcd-options.[ch],
	rcd-rpc-license.[ch].

	change to rcd_fetch_all_channels() parameters.
	(rcd_autopull_fetch_channel_list): Update for change to
	rcd_fetch_channel_list() parameters.

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_licenses, rcd_fetch_licenses_local):
	Added.  Fetches a list of licenses from the server (or off of
	disk) and parses them.
	(rcd_fetch_channel_list, rcd_fetch_channel_list_local,
	rcd_fetch_channel, rcd_fetch_channel_local,
	rcd_fetch_all_channels, rcd_fetch_all_channels_local,
	rcd_fetch_some_channels): Take an optional RCWorld argument, pass
	it around, to various rc_world functions, etc.

	* rcd-license.c: New file, deals with package licenses.

	* rcd-module.c (load_module): Fix a buglet where we were printing
	out the addresses of the module version numbers instead of the
	numbers themselves.

	* rcd-module.h: Bump up the RCD_MODULE_MAJOR_VERSION to 2 because
	of API changes in rcd-fetch.h.

	* rcd-options.c: New file, deals with command-line options.
	Really cleans up a lot of extern mess around the place.

	* rcd-prefs.c (get_config_path): Use accessor functions in
	rcd-options to get the config file to use.
	(rcd_prefs_get_remove_server_enabled): First check the
	command-line option before checking the config file.
	(rcd_prefs_get_remote_server_port): Ditto.

	* rcd-query.c (rcd_query_type_int_compare): Move a
	g_assert_not_reached() and a return into the switch statement to
	shut up gcc.

	* rcd-rpc-license.c: New file, adds RPC methods for dealing with
	package licnenses.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c ((refresh_channels_cb): Create a temporary
	world for our refresh so we can migrate all of the new channel
	data at once to fix odd races with rc and flicker with
	red-carpet.  Also refresh licenses, move loading of subscriptions
	out of here.  Also always pass in the list of pending ids to
	check_pending_status_cb() even if we aren't polling on them; fixes
	an unlikely race with possible duplicate packages.
	(check_pending_status_cb): Once we're done with the refresh,
	migrate the data from the temporary world over to the real world.
	(migrate_world_data): New function, cleans out old world data,
	migrates temporary world data over, and loads subscriptions.
	(packsys_refresh_channel): Update for rcd_fetch_channel() API
	change.

	* rcd-rpc-system.c (system_restart): RPC method to have the daemon
	restart itself.

	field to the XML-RPC representation of a package.

	* rcd-rpc-util.h: Add RCD_RPC_FAULT_LICENSE_NOT_FOUND.

	* rcd-rpc.c (rcd_rpc_server_start): Don't take a port number
	anymore.  Use the accessor functions in rcd-options to figure out
	the right IP address to bind to an the port number.  Also unref
	the SoupServer so it gets shutdown when the daemon is shutdown or
	restarted and so the port doesn't stay open.
	(rcd_rpc_init): Remove some #if 0 code.

	* rcd-shutdown.c (shutdown_idle_cb): Take a flag whether to
	restart as the user_data to this function.  If we're being
	restarted, exec ourselves.
	(rcd_shutdown): Make this just a wrapper around do_shutdown()
	(rcd_restart): Added.

	* rcd-transfer-http.c (http_open): Get the no network flag from an
	rcd-options accessor function.

	* rcd.c: Remove all the command-line option parsing from this
	file.  Any time we need that info, call an rcd-options accessor
	function.
	(initialize_rpc): Register our license rpc functions.
	(initialize_data): Update fetch functions for new API.  Always try
	downloading license info.
	(main): Call rcd_options_parse() to parse options, don't do stupid
	things with passing the port to rcd_rpc_server_start().

2003-04-03  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transaction.c (check_download_space): make sure the cache
	directory exists before calling statvfs, and if statvfs fails,
	return, don't try to divide by the 0 blocksize.

2003-04-02  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transaction.c (verify_packages): don't set the gpg keyring
	here

	* rcd-rpc-mirror.c: Added.  An xml-rpc interface for dealing with
	mirrors.

	* Makefile.am (rcd_SOURCES): Added rcd-mirror.[ch] and
	rcd-rpc-mirror.[ch].
	
	* rcd.c (initialize_data): Fetch the mirrors list at start-up.
	(initialize_rpc): Register our mirror-related methods.

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_mirrors): Added.  Downloads & parses
	the mirrors file.
	(rcd_fetch_mirrors_local): Added.  Tries to fetch the locally
	cached version of the mirrors file.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (refresh_channels_cb): Refresh the list of
	mirrors along with the channels, new, etc.

2003-03-28  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-recurring.c: Add a bunch of debugging code so we can see
	what's going on when the heatbeats aren't running at regular
	intervals.

2003-03-27  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-autopull.c (rcd_autopull_find_targets): Update
	rc_world_foreach_system_upgrade() call and don't require that we
	be subscribed to the channel to get the update.
	(autopull_refresh): Call xml_fetch_execute() instead of
	rcd_autopull_download_xml() so we refresh the data off disk in
	debug mode.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_get_updates, packsys_update_summary):
	Update rc_world_foreach_system_upgrade() call and get subscribed
	channels only.

2003-03-25  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-prefs.c (rcd_rpc_prefs_register_methods): Update the
	descriptions for a few entries.  Fixes part of #40263.

2003-03-19  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-cache.c (rcd_cache_expire_now): Added.  Expires an entire
	cache immediately.
	(rcd_cache_size): Added.  Gets the total size of the cache in
	bytes.

	* rcd-expire.c (rcd_expire_all): Added.  Does the actual expiring.
	(rcd_expire_foreach): Make this a publicly exported function.

	* rcd-rpc-system.c (system_get_cache_size, system_flush_cache):
	Added.  RPC wrappers around the above functions.

2003-03-17  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* rcd-prefs.c, rcd-prefs.h: add the ability to have settings not
	auto-saved, defaults to the current behavior.  Should have no
	effect at all on rcd.  :)

2003-03-17  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* rcd-query.c: remove two unnecessary includes

	* rcd-identity.h: "rcd-privileges.h", not <rcd-privileges.h>

2003-03-17  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transaction.c (transact_step_cb): move the update of the
	pending object to after the addition of the corresponding message,
	so that update signal handlers will see the appropriate message.

2003-03-17  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* rcd-pending.c, rcd-pending.h: add a message signal that is
	emitted whenever a new message is added to an RCDPending object.

2003-03-13  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-util.h: Add RCD_RPC_FAULT_NOT_SUPPORTED

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_rollback_dependencies,
	packsys_get_rollback_packages): Throw the not supported fault if
	our packman doesn't support it.  (Fixes #39015)

	* rcd-rpc-util.c: Add lone semicolons after labels with no
	statements to shut newer gccs up.

	* rcd-transaction.c (transact_progess_cb): RPM sends a total size
	of 0 for some packages -- I'm not sure why -- but in those cases
	don't try to update the pending.  This fixes the many glib
	warnings when installing certain packages.

2003-03-11  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transaction.c (download_packages): Fix a crash where we're
	asked to download a package without an update section (which means
	that we're trying to install a package that's already installed on
	the system, which means a client bug... but we still shouldn't
	crash).  Now we just fail the transaction happily.

2003-03-11  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_register): Add a fourth argument,
	err_msg, which is filled out when activation fails.  Check the
	X-RC-Error header for an error message and return it.

	* rcd-rpc-system.c (system_activate, system_activate_with_alias):
	Add an err_msg parameter, set an XML-RPC fault if it's present.
	(get_recurring_cb): Add an extra semicolon after the "cleanup"
	label to keep gcc from complaining.

	* rcd-rpc-util.h: Add RCD_RPC_FAULT_CANT_ACTIVATE.

	* rcd.c (initialize_data): Update the rcd_fetch_register() call.

2003-03-10  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_register): Add a third argument, alias,
	for activating when a hostname is not sufficient to distinguish a
	machine.  Send it along in the X-RC-Alias HTTP header.

	* rcd-rpc-system.c (system_activate_with_alias): Added, takes a
	third argument which is the alias.
	(system_activate): Call rcd_fetch_register() with a NULL third
	argument.

	* rcd.c (initialize_data): Call rcd_fetch_register() with a third
	NULL argument.

2003-03-07  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (resolve_deps): Walk across the list of
	packages to remove and make sure that the RCPackage structs
	correspond to the "system" package, not the "channel" package.  If
	not, we replace the "channel" package with the "system" package;
	otherwise it is easy to construct examples where dependency
	resolution will go very, very wrong.

2003-03-05  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (refresh_channels_cb): Refresh news as well.

2003-03-01  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am (rcdinclude_HEADERS): Add rcd-identity.h.

2003-02-13  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* rcd-package-locks.c: Add locking sequnece number.
	(rcd_package_locks_get_sequence_number): Implement.
	(rcd_package_locks_save): Implement, increase seq. number.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (rcd_rpc_packsys_register_methods): Register
	packsys.lock_sequence_number method.
	(packsys_lock_sequence_number): Implement.

2003-02-11  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transfer-http.c (map_soup_error_to_rcd_transfer_error): Get
	the error phrase from message->errorphrase instead of calling
	soup_error_get_phrase() because we'll get more detailed info from
	it.  (Like "Unable to resolve hostname" instead of "Can't
	connect").

2003-02-11  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-query-packages.c (summary_match, description_match,
	text_match): Guard against the possibility of NULL summaries and
	descriptions.  I actually have a package installed without a
	description tag which was causing rcd to crash.

2003-02-11  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transfer-http.c (map_soup_error_to_rcd_transfer_error): Fix
	a buglet where if a transfer failed it would print the proxy URL
	(or "(null)") instead of the real URL.

2003-02-04  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-cache.c (rcd_cache_entry_set_modification_time,
	rcd_cache_entry_set_entity_tag): Free the old one, fix a leak.

2003-02-04  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_news): Clear the cached news before
	fetching.
	(rcd_fetch_news_local): Clear the cached news before fetching.
	(fetch_icon_cb): Don't leak the icon's local filename.

	* rcd-news.c (rcd_news_clear): g_slist_free after the loop
	finishes, not inside the loop.  This would have been a crasher,
	but luckily this function was never called.

	* rcd-transaction.c (rcd_transaction_status_ref): Add a paranoid
	check of status->refs.
	(rcd_transaction_status_unref): Add a paranoid check of
	status->refs.

2003-01-31  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transaction.c (rcd_transaction_status_unref): g_slist_free()
	the package lists after unreffing them.
	(rcd_transaction_begin, rcd_transaction_log_to_server):
	g_slist_copy() the install_packages and remove_packages lists
	coming in so they don't get freed from out underneath us.

2003-01-29  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-privileges.c (rcd_privileges_init): Add a "lock" privilege
	to the base privileges.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (rcd_rpc_packsys_register_methods): Make
	rcd.packsys.add_lock() and rcd.packsys.remove_lock() require the
	"lock" privilege, not the "subscribe" privilege.

2003-01-29  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transaction.c (verify_packages): Check our trusted privilege
	before we send a message to the client.  If we're trusted, tell
	the user that when we say that the package is unsigned or we
	cannot verify.

2003-01-28  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc.c: If the user can't be authenticated over HTTP, we
	should send an HTTP 401 code back instead of an XML-RPC fault.
	(soup_auth_callback): Move the authentication code into here.  If
	we fail, return FALSE which will reissue the HTTP auth challenge
	to a client.
	(soup_rpc_callback): This function becomes a lot simpler since it
	doesn't handle authentication any longer.  If we get the MID as
	the user, set up an identity with name "server" and superuser
	privileges, otherwise get it from the password file and assert
	that an identity exists.  (It must, since we passed
	authentication).

2003-01-28  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-users.c (users_get_current_user): Return the current
	user, so clients don't have to muck around with the transport.
	(users_update): Fix a mis-pointered RCDPrivileges declaration.
	(rcd_rpc_users_register_methods): Register
	rcd.users.get_current_user.

2003-01-28  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-users.c (users_update): Handle our own privilege
	authorization here, so we can allow users to change their own
	passwords.  Throw a permission denied fault if the user isn't a
	superuser and the usernames don't match or a user tries to change
	his own privileges.
	(rcd_rpc_users_register_methods): Change the required privs to
	NULL, since we handle them in the method itself.

2003-01-25  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_find_dangling_requires): Added a new
	method that walks across the requirements list of every package
	and checks to make sure that some other package provides that
	requirement.  We return a list of packages and requirements for
	which this is not the case.

	* rcd-about.c (rcd_about_copyright): Updated copyright string.

2003-01-24  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_rollback_dependencies): Make the
	rollback channel silent.

	* rcd-rpc-users.c (users_sequence_number): Added.  A method for
	returning the identity sequence number.
	(rcd_rpc_users_register_methods): Register the
	rcd.users_sequence_number method.

	* rcd-identity.c: Added a static guint for storing the
	identity-change sequence number, which can be used to detect
	changes to users and permissions.
	(rcd_identity_update_password_file): Increment the identity
	sequence number.
	(rcd_identity_remove_from_password_file): Increment the identity
	sequence number.
	(rcd_identity_get_sequence_number): Added.  Returns the identity
	sequence number.

2003-01-23  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-identity.c (write_identity): Oops!  -1 (aka
	(gint64)~(guint64)0) is already used internally by the
	RCDPrivileges code to represent superuser privileges.  So that
	means that due to the last change, it is no longer possible to
	make anyone a superuser.  Fixed by replacing -1 with a magic
	symbol, RCD_PRIVILEGES_UNCHANGED.
	
	* rcd-rpc-users.c (users_update): Set id->privileges to
	RCD_PRIVILEGES_UNCHANGED.

	* rcd-privileges.h: #define RCD_PRIVILEGES_UNCHANGED to be
	a something safe (i.e. != -1).

2003-01-22  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-identity.c (write_identity): Make -1, not 0, mean "no
	changes" when writing out the password file to disk.  Fixes
	#36257, in which you couldn't take all users' privileges away.

	* rcd-rpc-users.c (users_update): Set id->privileges to -1, not 0.

2003-01-20  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-autopull.c: Added 'channels_to_install' field to RCDAutopull
	struct.
	(install_whole_channel_cb): Added.  Iterator function for
	installing entire channel.
	(rcd_autopull_find_targets): Process the list of channels to
	install.
	(rcd_autopull_unref): Free the list of channels to install.
	(rcd_autopull_new): Initialize the list of channels to install.
	(channel_from_xml_props): Support check for the
	'install_everything' property.
	(channel_from_xml_props): Fix some out-of-order debug spew.
	(We were spewing a value before computing it, which was not
	particularly helpful.)
	(channel_from_xml_node): Support checking for the
	'install_everything' property.
	(package_from_xml_node): Pass NULL as the second argument
	to channel_from_xml_props, explicitly ignoring the
	'install_everything' property.
	(rcd_autopull_xml_contains_unknown_channels): Ditto.
	(autopull_from_session_xml_node): Check for the 'install_everything'
	property in a channel tag.  If it is present, add the channel
	to our list of channels to install.  (The channel will also be
	updated.)

2003-01-20  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c, rcd-transfer-http.c: If we ever have problems
	with the URL returned from rcd_prefs_get_proxy(), show the URL to
	the user from rcd_prefs_get_proxy_url().

2003-01-15  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_rc_channel_to_xmlrpc): Export the
	"transient" flag so it's easier for clients to determine what
	channels can be unmounted.

2003-01-14  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-module.c (load_module): Add module versioning.  Read the
	rcd_module_major_version and (optionally) rcd_module_minor_version
	symbols out of the module and complain if they're not there or
	insufficient.

	* rcd-rpc-sample.c, rcd-autopull.c: Add rcd_module_major_version
	and rcd_module_minor_version symbols and assign them to
	RCD_MODULE_MAJOR_VERSION and RCD_MODULE_MINOR_VERSION
	respectively.

	* rcd-rpc-prefs.c (rcd_rpc_prefs_register_pref): Add a category
	argument which helps clients categorize the various daemon
	options.

2003-01-10  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_set_require_verified_certificates): Use
	soup_set_ssl_ca_file() instead of _ca_dir() because the latter
	sucks.

	* rcd.c (main): Ditto.

2002-12-20  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (refresh_channels_cb): We don't want to
	recurse refreshing channels during multiple heartbeats due to a
	time warp.

	* rcd-rpc.c (rcd_rpc_server_start): Get the host to bind to first
	from the command-line, then from rcd.conf.

	* rcd.c (option_parsing): Add -i for binding to only one network
	interface and --version because we didn't have it before.
	(main): If --version is passed, print out version and copyright
	info and exit happily.

2002-12-17  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-autopull.c (rcd_autopull_resolve_and_transact): We need to
	send a log message back to the server, even if no action is
	necessary.  (Fixes bug #35743)

	* rcd-transaction.c (rcd_transaction_begin): If the transaction is
	empty, just send a success message back to the server.

	* rcd-recurring.c (rcd_recurring_execute): Removed an unused
	variable's declaration.

	* rcd-autopull.c: Include rcd-rpc.h to get rid of a compiler
	warning.

2002-12-14  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-recurring.c (rcd_recurring_execute): If the RCDRecurring
	doesn't have a 'next' method, treat it as a non-recurring
	action.

2002-12-12  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-autopull.c (rcd_module_load): Register an
	rcd.autopull.refresh RPC method.
	(autopull_refresh): Implement the method.

2002-12-10  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_set_repackage): Added.

	* rcd-rpc-prefs.c (rcd_rpc_prefs_register_pref): Check to see if
	our packman handles repackaging and register the repackage pref if
	so.

	* rcd-transaction.c (run_transaction): Get whether we can
	repackage before we can transact and use it throughout to avoid a
	minor race.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (dep_get_package_info_cb): Change "replaces"
	to "replaced by" and "depends on" to "depended on".

2002-12-10  Frank Belew  <frb@ximian.com>

	* rcd.c: added #ifdef NEED_KERNEL_FD_WORKAROUND and appropriate line
	of code

2002-12-09  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd.c: Add a --no-modules flag which does what you think it does.

2002-12-09  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-autopull.c (rcd_autopull_fetch_channel_list): Re-load
	our subscriptions after fetching the channel list.  (Fixes
	bug #33387)

2002-12-06  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transfer.[ch]: Add a new transfer error,
	RCD_TRANSFER_ERROR_NETWORK_DISABLED.

	* rcd-transfer-http.c (http_open): If no_network is set, immediate
	set an error of NETWORK_DISABLED.

	* rcd.c (option_parsing): Add a no-networking command-line option.
	(initialize_data): Check to make sure no_network is not set before
	getting channel list, channel data, and news from the local cache.

2002-12-06  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd.c (daemonize): Write out the pidfile to /var/run/rcd.pid and
	set up a shutdown handler to remove it when we quit.

2002-12-05  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (refresh_channels_cb): I've changed the order
	that things happen.  First we refresh the transient channels.
	Next we download the channel list from the server, and the finally
	we refresh the persistent channels.  This insures that the
	transient channels (i.e. the mounted channels) get refreshed
	even if the network is not available.  (Fixes #34702)

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_some_channels): Added.  Allow
	finer-grained selection of the channels to be fetched.
	(rcd_fetch_all_channels_local): Changed to just call
	rcd_fetch_some_channels w/ the appropriate flags.
	(rcd_fetch_all_channels): Ditto.

2002-12-05  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_rollback_dependencies): Create the
	temporary rollback channel with a very high priority so that
	dependencies are pulled from that channel first.  Add a lame hack
	which sets the "package_filename" field on the XML-RPC struct,
	since the rollback channel is temporary only for dependency
	resolution and the XML-RPC struct references the channel by id
	which won't exist when it comes time to install the packages.

2002-12-04  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_register): Also enable premium mode when
	activating and getting the X-RC-Host header.

2002-12-04  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-unix-server.c (read_data): If our iochannel has an error
	condition set, free our handle and stop watching the channel.
	(conn_accept): Watch for non-standard conditions (G_IO_ERR,
	G_IO_HUP, G_IO_NVAL) on our iochannel.

2002-12-03  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_register): After activating, if the
	X-RC-Host header is set, set the machine's host to that value.

2002-12-03  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_rc_package_from_xmlrpc_package): Don't
	bother looking at the installed bit at all.  If the channel id is
	set, always look for the package in that channel.  Otherwise, fall
	back onto the system packages.  Should fix a crash when you try to
	install a package from a channel that's already installed.

2002-12-03  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd.c (daemonize): Change our CWD to / after forking.  Spotted
	my Mike MacDonald.

2002-12-03  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transaction.c (rcd_transaction_begin): If we don't need to
	download anything, launch an idle function to call verify_packages
	instead of calling it directly.  This allows the call to
	rcd_transaction_begin to return immediately, instead of making us
	wait for the (sometimes lengthy) verification process to finish.

2002-12-02  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: Install a bunch of headers that might be useful to
	modules.

	* rcd-module.c (rcd_module_debug): Added.  Thin wrapper around
	rc_debug() so modules don't need to pull in libredcarpet.

	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_{get|set}_{string|int|boolean}): Added.
	Generic functions for modules to use rcd.conf.

	* rcd-query.h: Include <glib.h>, not "libredcarpet.h"

	* rcd-rpc-prefs.h: Kill the _full function for registering prefs;
	they don't seem all that useful and it keeps modules from needing
	to link against xmlrpc-c.

	* rcd.c (main): Initialize modules before initializing the data.

2002-11-22  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transaction.c (add_rollback_packages): Initialize the GError
	to NULL.  Set the dirty flag on the directory if there's an
	invalid package file in there.

2002-11-22  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_rc_package_from_xmlrpc_package): Always deal
	with package_data and package_filename fields first, so that we
	always return a package created with rc_packman_query_file() and
	not potentially a system package.  This will fix a crash when
	trying to install packages that are already installed on the system.

2002-11-22  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transaction.c (fail_transaction): Send the log, even if
	flags are set.
	(download_completed): Send the log in the event of a download
	failure, even if flags are set.
	(run_transaction): Send the log, even if this is a dry run.

2002-11-20  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-autopull.c: (struct _RCDAutopull): Added the "dry_run" flag.
	(get_removal_failure_info): Broke up a few lines to keep the
	source code < 80 chars/line.
	(rcd_autopull_resolve_and_transact): If this is a dry run, set the
	appropriate flags and pass them into any calls to
	rcd_transaction_log_to_server (when reporting dependency failures)
	and rcd_transaction_begin (when actually doing the transaction).
	(autopull_from_session_xml_node): If the dry_run property is set
	to a non-zero value in the session tag, set the dry_run flag
	in the RCDAutopull struct.

	* rcd-transaction.c (transaction_xml): When constructing the XML
	to pass back to the server, report whether or not the
	RCD_TRANSACTION_FLAGS_DRY_RUN flag is set.
	(rcd_transaction_log_to_server): Add an argument for passing
	in the RCDTransactionFlags.

2002-11-20  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_get_host): Get rid of RCX_MAGIC and
	RC_MAGIC.  Everyone should just use the host preference instead.
	(rcd_prefs_get_proxy): If the proxy URL is invalid, return the
	invalid string instead of NULL so rcd-transfer can handle it and
	abort properly.

	* rcd-transfer-http.c (http_open): If we have a proxy_url but
	can't get a proxy_context from Soup, then the URI is invalid and
	set an error as such.

	* rcd-transfer.c (rcd_transfer_begin_blocking): If
	rcd_transfer_begin() returns -1, don't run the main loop.

2002-11-14  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_xmlrpc_to_rc_package_dep): Sniff out debian
	or-deps and pass them to rc_package_dep_new_from_spec().

2002-11-13  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-cache.c (rcd_cache_entry_close, rcd_cache_entry_cancel):
	Reset the fd field back to -1 after closing.
	(rcd_cache_entry_open): Add a precondition requiring the fd field
	be -1.

	* rcd-transfer-http.c (http_info): Change the conditional for
	opening a cache entry to only do it on a 200-class (Sucessful)
	response.  Before we were opening a cache entry on things that we
	shouldn't have been (like 302 Found) and occasionally leaking fds
	(for things like 302 Found and then 200 OK)

2002-11-11  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc.c (rcd_rpc_init): Tune the maximum size of the XML-RPC
	requests so we can handle extremely large requests better.

2002-11-08  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transaction.c (run_transaction): Remove the lock check and
	lock call from here.
	(verify_packages): Move it into here.  Instead of doing it
	manually, call fail_transaction() whenever anything goes wrong and
	unlock the transaction lock

	* rcd.c (rehash_data): If the transaction isn't locked, call
	initialize_data().  Otherwise, (if not already there) set a
	timeout to call itself again until we can successfully rehash our
	data.  Prevents nasty reentrancy during transactions.

2002-11-08  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_get_channel_icon): If the channel
	just doesn't have an icon, throw a fault before we go around
	dereferencing NULL pointers.  Also fix a potential leak.
	(parse_rollback_package_array): Fix the formatting of a thrown
	fault.

2002-11-06  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd.c (debug_message_handler): When logging rcd-messages,
	prepend a timestamp.  When logging to syslog, add the pid to the
	name when calling openlog() to be more consistent with other apps,
	and don't put it in the message itself.

2002-11-06  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd.c (option_parsing): Move debug_level and syslog_level out of
	here and make them global options.  Don't call
	rcd_prefs_set_{debug|syslog}_level() since we don't want the
	command-line option to get saved to disk.

	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_get_{debug|syslog}_level): If the global
	debug_level or syslog_level option isn't -1, return its value,
	otherwise get it from the config file.
	(rcd_prefs_set_{debug|syslog}_level): Reset the global debug_level
	or syslog_level option, so that setting the level overrides the
	level passed in at the command-line.

2002-11-05  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-query.c (rcd_query_match_string, rcd_query_match_string_ci):
	Allow globbing in string equality searches.

2002-11-01  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>
 
 	* rcd-rpc-system.c (system_get_recurring): Added.  An xml-rpc
 	function that returns a list of all of the pending recurring
 	actions.
 	(rcd_rpc_system_register_methods): Register our new method.
 
 	* rcd-heartbeat.c (rcd_heartbeat_start): Set the recurring's label
 	function to NULL.
 
 	* rcd-autopull.c (rcd_autopull_new): Set the recurring's label
 	function to NULL.
 	(recurring_autopull_xml_fetch_init): Ditto.
 
 	* rcd-recurring.c (rcd_recurring_get_label): Added.
 	(rcd_recurring_execute): Store last execution time and increment
	execution counter.

2002-11-01  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-prefs.c: Fix up some sucky descriptions

2002-10-24  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_rollback_dependencies): After we tear
	down our temporary rollback channel, reset the channel field on
	all its packages to NULL.

2002-10-23  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (refresh_channels_cb): If the distro isn't
	supported or deprecated, don't refresh channel data.

2002-10-22  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transaction.c (transaction_step_cb): Update the
	transaction_pending with the sequence number.

2002-10-21  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_packages_abort): Unref all of the queued
	transfers before the running transfers.  Don't free the closure,
	that'll be done after the last running transfer is cancelled.

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_rc_package_from_xmlrpc_package): If the
	installed bit is set on the package, get it out of the system
	packages in the world.

	* rcd-transaction.c (rcd_transaction_status_unref): Set the
	"status" field on the download_pending to NULL so we don't point
	at a junk pointer.

2002-10-22  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (assemble_spec): When processing an xmlrpc struct
	into a RCPackageSpec, check for a "version_str" field.  If it is
	found, use rc_packman_parse_version to extract the EVR from that
	string.

2002-10-18  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_search_by_package_match): Initialize
	an uninitialized variable.

2002-10-17  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd.c (initialize_data): Move the call to rcd_package_locks_load
	here from in initialize_rc_world... if we load the packages before
	the channel data has been fetched, we are unable to resolve the
	channel IDs in the locks to RCChannel objects and things go
	downhill from there.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_search_by_package_match): Added.
	(packsys_remove_lock): Added.
	(rcd_rpc_packsys_register_methods): Register our new methods.

2002-10-16  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-fetch.c: Remove the Soup crash workarounds.
	(package_completed_cb): Only remove from the hash table and free the
	closure if we have no more running or queued transfers.
	(rcd_fetch_packages_abort): Remove from the hash table and free
	the closure after we're done aborting transfers.

	* rcd-transaction.c (download_packages): Start the download
	pending object before checking disk space, so we can fail it if we
	don't have enough.  Don't unref the packages_to_download list, as
	that's done by cleanup_after_transaction() via fail_transaction().

2002-10-16  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-fetch.c: RCX_ACTIVATION_ROOT should be https.

	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_{set|get}_require_verified_certificates):
	New preference for whether we need to verify SSL certificates.
	Defaults to on (obviously).

	* rcd-rpc-prefs.c: Allow the above to be get/set by superuser.

	* rcd-transfer-http.c (http_open): If we're in HTTP 1.0 mode, set
	Connection: close explicitly.

	* rcd.c (main): If we require verified certificates, set the Soup
	CA dir.

2002-10-15  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-users.c (users_update): Allow the "-*-unchanged-*-"
	token through, even though it isn't a well-formed md5ified
	password.

2002-10-15  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_register): Make this return a gboolean,
	TRUE on success.  Take two arguments: the activation code and
	email address for handling activation as well as registration.
	If we're already in premium mode, connect to the current server.
	Otherwise connect to activation.rc.ximian.com.  Don't send out a
	(nonexistent) org id if we're activating.  Do send out the
	activation code and email, however.

	* rcd-rpc-system.c (system_activate): Added.  Takes an activation
	code and email and activates the system with them.
	(rcd_rpc_system_register_methods): Register rcd.system.activate.

	* rcd.c (initialize_data): Call rcd_fetch_register() with NULL for
	the activation code and email.

2002-10-15  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc.c (soup_rpc_callback): Allow the server to call to the
	client by authenticating with the mid and the shared secret.

2002-10-11  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-heartbeat.c (rcd_heartbeat_start): Don't start the heartbeat
	if it's disabled.

	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_set_heartbeat_interval): Allow a value of
	0, which means that the heartbeat is disabled.  Start or stop the
	heartbeat if necessary.

	* rcd-rpc-users.c (users_has_privilege): Add a
	rcd.users.has_privilege() method which checks to see if the user
	making the call has the specified privilege.

2002-10-10  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: Add rcd-rollback.[ch] to the build.

	* rcd-fetch.c (package_completed_cb): If the "is_signature" flag
	is set, set the signature_filename field instead of the
	package_filename.
	(download_package_file): If is_signature is set on the func, set
	it on the transfer object.
	(rcd_fetch_packages): Set is_signature appropriately.

	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_get_repackage): Add a pref for
	repackaging.

	* rcd-rollback.[ch]: Added.  Maintains a manifest of the available
	packages to rollback.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_rollback_dependencies): Added.
	Creates a temporary channel for the rollback packages, looks up
	the packages specified, and does a dependency resolution on them.
	(packsys_get_rollback_packages): Returns a list of the rollback
	packages.
	(rcd_rpc_packsys_register_methods): Add in the rollback functions.

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_xmlrpc_array_copy): Copies (and
	concatenates) xmlrpc arrays.

	* rcd-transaction.c (run_transaction): If the repackaging
	capability is set and repackaging is enabled, create and set up a
	temporary directory to put the repackaged packages.  After the
	transaction has finished, add the repackaged packages to the
	rollback list.
	(check_package_integrity): Call rc_packman_get_error() after
	verifying since that's the right thing to do.  Shuffle things
	around a little bit to deal with broken repackaged rpms.

2002-10-10  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: Add rcd-package-locks.h and rcd-package-locks.c to
	the build.

	* rcd-package-locks.h:
	* rcd-package-locks.c: Added.  Contains code to load/save lists
	of locks as XML.

	* rcd-fetch.c (remove_channel_cb): Don't remove channels that have
	refresh magic.
	(rcd_fetch_channel): If a channel has refresh magic, use it.
	(rcd_fetch_channel_local): Ditto.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_get_locks): Added.
	(packsys_add_lock): Added.
	(packsys_mount_directory): Added.
	(packsys_unmount_directory): Added.
	(rcd_rpc_packsys_register_methods): Register our new xmlrpc
	methods.

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_rc_package_match_to_xmlrpc): Added.
	(rcd_xmlrpc_to_rc_package_match): Added.
	(rcd_rc_package_to_xmlrpc): Set the "locked" attribute indicating
	whether or not the package is locked.

2002-10-08  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_distro): Make this return a gboolean,
	TRUE on success.

	* rcd.c (main): If rcd_fetch_distro() returns FALSE, throw an
	error and abort.

2002-10-01  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-cache.c (rcd_cache_entry_get_modification_time): Use %Z
	instead of %z so we get "GMT" instead of "+0000" to be truly RFC
	1123 compliant.
	(rcd_cache_lookup): If our initial lookup in our in-memory cache
	fails, create an entry if the file exists on the local disk and
	use it.

2002-10-01  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transaction.c: Get rid of the HAVE_STATVFS conditionals.
	Linux has it too, and it works just as we expect it, so just use
	it everywhere since that's what Solaris has too.

	* rcd-unix-server.c: Add conditionals for HAVE_SO_PEERCRED, so we
	don't try to verify credentials on Solaris, which doesn't have
	them.  Also work around Solaris's crappiness by moving the socket
	from /var/run/rcd to /var/run/rcd/rcd, since Solaris lets anyone
	write to unix domain sockets they can see, regardless of
	filesystem permissions.

	* rcd.c: Define POPT_TABLEEND if it isn't already.  Fix a compiler
	warning on Solaris.

2002-09-30  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (extra_dump_info): Also dump out the host URL,
	whether it's a premium server, and the proxy URL.

2002-09-26  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_channel_list_local): Clean out the
	world's channels before we add our own.

2002-09-25  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transaction.c (fail_transaction): Make this call
	cleanup_after_transaction() so we don't leak RCDTransactionStatus
	objects.
	(download_packages): If the package we're installing is a local
	one and the integrity of a package can't be confirmed, we have to
	fail the transaction, since we can't fallback to one from the
	'net.  Fix a refcount leak in the case where we fail due to
	insufficient disk space.
	(rcd_transaction_begin): Because fail_transaction() calls
	cleanup_after_transaction() which unrefs the status, we have to
	ref it before we actually start the transaction and unref it after
	we're done using it.

2002-09-24  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-autopull.c (rcd_autopull_fetch_channel_list): Pass along the
	return value from the call to rcd_fetch_channel_list.
	(process_xml_cb): Fix the signature of this function so we don't
	get a type warning.
	(rcd_autopull_xml_contains_unknown_packages): Scan the autopull
	XML for unknown packages.
	(rcd_autopull_process_xml): Check if the XML mentions unknown
	packages.  If it does, re-fetch all of the package info.

2002-09-23  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-autopull.c (rcd_autopull_fetch_all_channels): We don't use
	the RCDAutopull we were passing in, so that argument has been
	removed.
	(rcd_autopull_fetch_channel_list): Added.  Re-fetch the channel
	list and then call rcd_autopull_fetch_all_channels.
	(rcd_autopull_xml_contains_unknown_channels): A renamed
	rcd_autopull_check_xml_for_unknown_channels that returns a
	boolean.
	(process_xml_cb): The code that actually processes the autopull
	XML.  This used to be in rcd_autopull_process_xml, but is now in a
	callback that can be executed after the channel info is refreshed.
	(rcd_autopull_process_xml): If the XML contains unknown channels,
	reload the channel info before proceeding.
	(rcd_autopull_get_xml_from_file): rcd_autopull_process_xml now takes
	an xmlDoc, which it frees.
	(rcd_autopull_download_xml): Ditto.

2002-09-20  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-autopull.c (rcd_autopull_resolve_and_transact): Call
	rcd_transaction_log_to_server() and rcd_transaction_begin() with
	the autopull session name.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_transact): Send along a NULL
	transaction name to rcd_transaction_begin().

	* rcd-transaction.c: Add a "name" field to the
	RCDTransactionStatus struct.
	(rcd_transaction_unref): Free it here.
	(transaction_xml): Serialize the name, if it's set, for the
	logging.
	(rcd_transaction_log_to_server, rcd_transaction_begin): Take the
	transaction name as the first argument and copy it into the
	struct.

2002-09-20  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-autopull.c (rcd_autopull_fetch_all_channels): Added.
	Downloads package info for all channels and executes a callback
	when finishes.
	(rcd_autopull_ref): Added.
	(rcd_autopull_unref): Added.  RCDAutopull objects are now
	reference-counted.
	(ap_rec_destroy): Changed to just unref the RCDAutopull.
	(ap_rec_execute): Refresh all channels, then execute a callback
	which actually does the autopull.
	(ap_rec_execute_part_two): Added.  This is the callback that gets
	executed post-refresh.
	(ap_rec_first): Add 0-14 minutes of fuzz to our start time.
	(rcd_autopull_new): Initialize ->refs to 1.
	(rcd_autopull_check_xml_for_unknown_channels): Walk the XML
	looking for unknown channels.  If we find one we need to re-load
	the channel list, but this is not implemented yet.
	(rcd_autopull_process_xml): Call
	rcd_autopull_check_xml_for_unknown_channels.
	(rcd_module_load): Seed the random number generator, so that all
	clients don't get the same amount of fuzz added to their start
	time.  That would be bad.

2002-09-18  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transaction.c (verify_packages): Check for an RCPackman
	error immediately after calling rc_packman_verify(), since we
	could have gotten an error and a NULL list of verifications if,
	say, the package were truncated.

2002-09-17  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-autopull.c (get_removal_failure_info): Added.  Generates an
	error message if we need to remove more packages than those we
	explicitly requested.
	(rcd_autopull_resolve_and_transact): Write out the dependency
	failure info using rc_debug.  Check to see if the number of
	packages to be removed is greater than the number we explicitly
	asked to have removed.  If so, fail.
	(autopull_from_session_xml_node): If the 'remove' property is
	set on a package tag, schedule it for removal.

2002-09-17  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	unverified package signature and a non-existent signature.

2002-09-16  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_world_sequence_numbers): Renamed from
	packsys_world_sequence_number.  Now returns a tuple of our three
	sequence numbers (package, channel and subscriptions) instead of

	prefs.

2002-09-13  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_rc_package_to_xmlrpc): When checking our

	* rcd-rpc-prefs.c (rcd_rpc_prefs_register_methods): Added
	require-signatures.

	* rcd-transaction.c (verify_packages): Flush the main loop before
	each iteration.  Mark whether we have tried to verify a
	signature.  If checking the signature was indeterministic or
	wasn't there at all, flag a warning and send it to the client.  If
	we require signed packages and the user doesn't have the "trusted"
	privilege, abort.  (Previously, if you required signed packages,
	even trusted users couldn't install unsigned packages)

2002-09-13  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd.c (option_parsing): Add an -f option, which specifies the

	was trying to remove from the hash table by using the data and not
	the key.

	rcd_cache_entry_invalidate().

	* rcd-prefs.c: Get the config_file out of rcd.c and use it instead
	of the default if it's set.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_transact): Change the dry_run bool to
	a flags integer which specifies things like whether this is a dry
	run or download only transaction.  Pass that through to
	rcd_transaction_begin().

	* rcd-transaction.c: Replace dry_run with flags everywhere, and
	update the checks accordingly.
	(rcd_transaction_status_unref): Only unref the pendings if they're
	set.
	(cleanup_after_transaction): Don't cleanup temp files if the user
	is doing a download only transaction.
	(download_completed): Don't call verify_packages() if we're in a
	download only transaction.
	(rcd_transaction_begin): Don't create the transaction and step
	pending objects if we're in download only.  Set their IDs to -1 if
	they're NULL.  Don't call verify_packages() if we're in a download

	pid as arguments, instead of using the --pid option. (Also bug
	#29460)

	* rcd-autopull.c (package_from_xml_node): Removed some left-over
	debug spew.

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_rc_package_to_xmlrpc): If name_installed >
	0, this package has a greater version number than the installed
	package with the same name.  If name_installed < 0, the installed
	version is newer.

2002-09-11  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd.c (initialize_data): We always have to register before we
	ever download any channel data.  Don't know what crack I was
	smoking.

2002-09-11  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-query-packages.c (package_installed_match): Added.  This is
	a query method that returns true if the package is a system
	package or is an in-channel package that has the same EVR as a
	system package.
	Also created an entry in the query_packages_engine array for
	"package-installed".

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_rc_package_to_xmlrpc): Added a name_installed
	field to the package xml-rpc struct.  It is a flag that gets set
	if a package of the same name is installed on the system.

	the rcd_transaction_begin() API change.

	* rcd-cache.c (rcd_cache_entry_close): g_strdup() the filename
	before adding it as the key to the hash table.
	(rcd_cache_new): Call g_hash_table_new_full() and pass in g_free()
	as the key destroy func.

	* rcd-fetch.c: Get rid of package_transfer_id, we'll be using the
	download pending id now instead.

	pending_id as an argument.

	* rcd-pending.c (rcd_pending_get_error_msg): Added.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_transact): Update for the new

	download_pending if we're successful.  Otherwise abort or fail it.
	(download_packages): Create download_pending and begin
	it if we have packages to download.  Pass the id into
	rcd_fetch_packages().
	(rcd_transaction_begin): Make it a void function, take three out
	parameters which are for the download_pending id,
	transaction_pending id, and transaction_step_pending id.
	(check_install_auth): Takes an RCDTransactionStatus object and an
	RCDIdentity and determines if the identity has the authorization
	to cancel the download for the transaction.
	(rcd_transaction_abort): Added.  Given a download_id and an
	identity, abort the transaction if we can.

2002-09-10  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	prefs so clients can set them.

2002-09-06  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-cache.c: Key all cache entries by the local cache filename,
	not the URL.  This way we can do lookups based on the local
	filename, and files should be cached across hosts in the same
	session.

	* rcd-privileges.c (rcd_privileges_init): Added a "trusted"
	privilege to the base privileges.

	field with an RCDIdentity field.
	(verify_packages): Check to see if we have the trusted privilege
	before we install packages without (or with an inconclusive) GPG
	signature.
	(rcd_transaction_begin): We need to call verify_packages() even if
	we're not downloading anything.  Take an RCDIdentity argument
	instead of a const char * for the username.
	(check_package_integrity): Added.  Runs a size and md5sum
	verification on a package in the attempt to see if it's a valid
	package file.
	(dowwnload_packages): If the file already exists on the local
	filesystem, run a integrity check on it.  If it fails, invalidate
	it from the cache (if appropriate) and require it be downloaded
	again.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_transact): Pass in the identity
	instead of just the identity's username to
	rcd_transaction_begin().

	* rcd-autopull.c (rcd_autopull_resolve_and_transact): Create a
	dummy identity to pass into rcd_transaction_begin().

2002-09-05  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	description to the xml-rpc struct.

2002-09-03  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-prefs.c: The config file is now rcd.conf, to be more
	consistent with every other daemon configuration file.

	* rcd-identity.c: The ACL/password file is now rcd.passwd, to be more
	consistent with rcd.conf.

2002-09-03  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_rc_package_to_xmlrpc): Include the file
	size, installed size, and section info when we map an RCPackage to
	an xml-rpc struct.
	(rcd_rc_package_to_xmlrpc): We also need the section's user
	string.

2002-08-29  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd.c (is_supported_distro): Added.  Checks to see if we're on a
	supported distro and prints a warning to the logs if we're not.
	(initialize_data): Don't try to download a channel list or channel
	data if we're on an unsupported distribution.

2002-08-29  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_set_proxy_url,
	rcd_prefs_get_proxy_username, rcd_prefs_get_proxy_password): If
	the string coming in is NULL, unset the key rather than trying to
	set it to NULL (which doesn't work).

	* rcd-rpc-prefs.c (get_string_func): Use RC_STRING_TO_XMLRPC() so
	we don't pass in NULL to xmlrpc_build_value().
	(set_string_func): Use XMLRPC_STRING_TO_RC() so we get back NULL
	if the string is empty.

2002-08-28  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (prepend_pkg): Use the
	rc_package_status_is_to_be_installed macro.

	* rcd-autopull.c (pkg_install): Use the
	rc_package_status_is_to_be_installed macro.

2002-08-28  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-prefs.c: Add get/set preferences for the three proxy
	elements: URL, username, password.

	* rcd-rpc-prefs.c: Add privileges for getting and setting
	individual preferences.
	(RCDPrefTable): Add RCDPrivileges fields for getting and setting
	prefs.
	(get_pref): Get the method data and approve the get against the
	user's identity.
	(prefs_set_pref): Get the method data and approve the set against
	the user's identity.
	(prefs_list_prefs): Do a get_pref() on each pref and add it to the
	list if the user has privileges to see it.  When we're done, if it
	turns out the list of preferences the user can see is empty, throw
	a permission denied fault instead of returning an empty list.
	(rcd_rpc_prefs_register_pref_full, rcd_rpc_prefs_register_pref):
	Take a list of privileges for getting and setting a pref.
	(rcd_rpc_prefs_register_methods): Register the proxy prefs, and
	fix up all of the other prefs to have individual privileges.  Make
	the RPC calls approve anyone (since handling is done inside the
	calls now).

2002-08-28  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (build_updates_list): use
	rc_packman_version_compare, not rc_package_spec_compare

	* rcd.c (initialize_rc_world): no more rc_packman_set_packman or
	rc_world_register_packman, rc_world_new needs a packman, and
	rc_set_world that

2002-08-27  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transfer-http.c
	(rcd_transfer_protocol_http_get_response_body): Removed.  It's not
	used anywhere anymore, and since we overwrite chunks, it'll never
	work the way we want it to.

2002-08-27  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-autopull.c (rcd_autopull_resolve_and_transact): If we had
	failed deps, stringify the failure and send it as the reason
	instead of a generic "resolution failed" message.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (append_dep_info, dep_get_failure_info): Use a
	GString instead of allocating a bunch of temporary strings.

2002-08-26  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_distro): Added.  Downloads
	"distributions.xml" from the server, so we can dynamically change
	things like what distributions are supported, which are
	deprecated, etc.

	* rcd.c (main): Fix the rc_distro_parse_xml() FIXME; add a call to
	rcd_fetch_distro() to immediately before initializing the RCWorld.

	* rcd-transfer.c: Remove some errant FIXMEs.

2002-08-26  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	reopening std* correctly.
	(main): Add a SIGHUP handler.
	(sighup_handler): Added.  Closes and reopens stdout and stderr,

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_register): Get the contents of the transfer
	from the GByteArray returned from rcd_transfer_begin_blocking()
	instead of from the protocol backend.

2002-08-23  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_get_channel_icon): Um, close the file
	after we're done with it.

2002-08-23  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-cache.c (RCDCache): Add a user_data field.
	(icon_cache_filename_func): Added.  Munges an icon filename.
	(rcd_cache_get_icon_cache): Added.  Gets the icon cache and sets
	the channel_id as the cache's user_data.

2002-08-23  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-unix-server.c: Include sys/time.h, which is needed so that
	we pick up the definition of struct timeval on machines running an
	older glibc (like RH62).

	* rcd.c (option_parsing): Don't use the POPT_TABLEEND macro, since
	it isn't in the version of popt that comes with RH62.

2002-08-22  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-unix-server.c (SOCKET_PATH): Change from /tmp/rcd to

	logversion from the URL, Aidan says we don't need it.

2002-08-22  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: Remove rcd-transact-log.[ch].

	* rcd-transaction.c: Fold in the transaction logging into here,
	where it belongs.  Greatly simplify so it only makes one trip to
	the server instead of two.  Will depend on new logging code on the
	servers, though.  Make RCDTransactionStatus refcounted.

	* rcd-transact-log.[ch]: Removed.

	* rcd-autopull.c (rcd_autopull_resolve_and_transact): If we have
	failed dependencies, log it to the server.

	client_version arguments which identify the client requesting the
	transaction.
	(cleanup_after_transaction): Free the client_id and client_version
	when we're done.

	* rcd-transact-log.c (rcd_transact_log_send_transaction): Take the
	client_id and client_version as arguments, pass them into
	transaction_xml().
	(transaction_xml): Take the client_id and client_version and add
	them to the XML.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_transact): Take the client ID and
	client version as the fourth and fifth arguments and pass them
	into rcd_transaction_begin().

	* rcd-autopull.c (rcd_autopull_resolve_and_transact): Add
	client_id and client_version arguments to rcd_transaction_begin.

2002-08-21  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	(rcd_autopull_download_xml): Actually download the autopull XML.
	(xml_fetch_execute): Disable the file override.
	(rcd_autopull_resolve_and_transact): Be a bit more verbose in our
	logging.

2002-08-21  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_channel_list): Return a gboolean
	indicating success.  Before we add the channels from the XML,
	remove all of the previous channels.  Before, this was done before
	every call to rcd_fetch_channel_list().  Now, if we fail, we can
	just continue using what we already had in memory.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (refresh_channels_cb): Don't remove the
	channels from the world here, that's now done in
	rcd_fetch_channel_list() on success.  If fetching the channel list
	fails, set an invalid indicator.
	(packsys_refresh_all_channels): If we get an invalid list back
	from refresh_channels_cb(), set a fault.

	* rcd-rpc-util.h: Added RCD_RPC_FAULT_CANT_REFRESH.

	* rcd-transfer-http.c (http_read_data): If the HTTP response isn't
	in the 200 class, don't try to append data to the (unopened) cache
	entry.  Fixes a g_warning().

2002-08-21  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-autopull.c: Further hacking.  We are now pretty close to
	having autopull actually work.

2002-08-20  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd.c (main): Fixed memory leak.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (resolve_deps): OK, I didn't fully understand
	the semantics of the resolve_deps function before I lumbered in
	and started changing stuff.  We now properly filter the original
	install/remove requests out of the list of installs/removals that
	we return.

2002-08-20  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd.c (initialize_data): Don't check to see if we've registered
	previously.  Always try to register.
	(crash_handler): We can't just set SIG_DFL as the second argument;
	we have to create a struct sigaction with SIG_DFL as the
	sa_handler.

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_register): If we couldn't successfully
	register, send a warning out to the logs with a reason.

	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_{get|set}_registered): Removed.

	* rcd-transfer-http.c (http_done): Set the protocol's response
	body to whatever the server sends back.
	(http_free): Free the response_body.
	(rcd_transfer_protocol_http_get_response_body): Added.

2002-08-20  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c: Ugh... there was some deeply broken code in
	here.
	(prepend_pkg): Go back to just appending packages to a list,
	instead of trying to do fancy hash stuff.  Use the
	rc_package_status_is_to_be_uninstalled and rc_package_is_installed
	functions to check the status... looking directly inside of the
	structs is unreliable and will give you the wrong answer in some
	cases.
	(prepend_pkg_pair): Just append packages to a list, instead of
	trying to do fancy hash stuff.
	(remove_duplicate_packages): Given a list of packages, remove any
	duplicates.  Yes, this function is O(N^2)... but it has the
	decided advantage of actually being correct. :)
	(resolve_deps): Remove all of the hash cleverness, and just go
	back to accumulating our packages in lists.  The main problem was
	that the hashes were keyed on the package spec's quark...  but
	that is dangerously broken, since multiple packages with the same
	name can appear in the install/remove lists in some cases.

	* rcd.c (crash_handler): Restore the default SIGSEGV, SIGFPE and
	SIGBUS handlers after we enter our crash handler.  This makes our
	crash handling somewhat less flaky.

2002-08-19  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-autopull.c: Further hacking.

2002-08-17  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: Don't make rcd-buddy executable in the
	install-data-hook.

	* rcd.c (crash_handler): Invoke rcd-buddy as "python
	SHAREDIR/rcd-buddy".  Don't stat to check if the rcd-buddy is
	there, since we now do that check before seting up the crash
	handler.
	(main): Don't set up the crash handler if we can't find python in
	the path.

2002-08-13  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_transact): Expire the package
	cache before every transaction.

	* rcd-expire.c (rcd_expire_unlink): Added.  A static function that
	just wraps unlink and produces some debug spew.

	(rcd_expire_by_size): Use rcd_expire_unlink.

	* rcd-cache.c (rcd_cache_expire_package_cache): A convenience
	function to expire the package cache using the cache-related
	preferences as parameters.

	register a shutdown handler that expires the cache.

2002-08-13  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* rcd-log-entry.c (rcd_log_entry_parse): fix a crash, argh

2002-08-12  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-cache.c (rcd_cache_expire): Added.  Finds the directory the

	* rcd-rpc-prefs.c (rcd_rpc_prefs_register_methods): Register our
	cache expiration preferences.

	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_get_cache_cleanup_enabled): Added.

2002-08-12  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transaction.c (download_packages): Return an int instead of
	a gboolean.  If we have packages to download, check to make sure
	we have the disk space to store them.  Otherwise, lose it.
	Returns the number of packages to download now.

2002-08-12  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_get_cache_dir): Change the cache dir to
	/var/cache/redcarpet.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (refresh_channels_cb): Move the transaction
	lock call here so the heartbeat locks it and we don't get
	transaction lock warnings.
	(packsys_refresh_all_channels): Remove the lock call from here.

2002-08-09  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-cache.c (rcd_cache_lookup): If the file isn't there anymore,
	remove the cache entry from the cache before freeing it.  Duh.

	* rcd-transact-log.c (rcd_transact_log_send_transaction): Since
	it's very possible for a transaction to finish before the
	transaction manifest is even sent to the server, we need to
	allocate the transaction id slot on the heap.  Change this
	function to return a newly allocated slot for it.  God, this code
	is really nasty.  It should be integrated with rcd-transaction.c.
	(transaction_sent): If rcd_transact_log_send_success() got called
	before we did, free the tid slot.
	(success_sent): Free the tid and the slot.

2002-08-09  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transaction.[ch]: Added.  Splits out all of the directly
	package-transaction related stuff from rcd-rpc-packsys.c.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c: Most out all of the transaction
	stuff. Replace packsys_lock with
	rcd_transaction_[lock|unlock|is_locked]().
	(packsys_tranact): Make dry_run an xmlrpc_bool instead of a
	pointer to one.  Call rcd_transaction_begin().
	(packsys_abort_download): Call a bunch of rcd_transaction
	functions to see if we can abort this download.

	* Makefile.am: Add rcd-transaction.[ch].

2002-08-09  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* rcd-log-entry.c (spec_to_str): RCPackageSpec GQuark fixup
	(spec_from_str): GQuark fixup.  This function is so screwed.  It
	claims to take const char * parameters, and then uses those to
	populate a structure that, when freed, will free them.  Odd.
	(rcd_log_entry_parse): GQuark fixup.

	* rcd-log.c (package_name_match): GQuark fixup

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_resolve_dependencies,
	packsys_verify_dependencies): decref the xmlrpc_resolution_info
	values.  Fixes a leak.

2002-08-08  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-cache.c: Fix some cache contention issues...
	(rcd_cache_entry_new): Don't insert the cache entry into the cache
	immediately.
	(rcd_cache_entry_open): Instead of saving to package.tmp, use
	g_mkstemp(), and save the temporary filename in the cache entry.
	(rcd_cache_entry_close): Rename the file into place and insert it
	into the cache.
	(rcd_cache_entry_free): Free the temp filename.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (fail_transaction): Added.  Split out of

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (resolve_deps): Added an argument for passing
	out an xmlrpc array containing the xmlrpcified RCResolverInfo
	items generated during this resolution.  It is taken from the best
	context if our resolution succeeded, and from the first failed
	queue otherwise.
	(packsys_verify_dependencies): Get the resolution info from the
	call to resolve_deps, then pass it back as the third element of
	our returned tuple.
	(packsys_resolve_dependencies): Ditto.

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_rc_resolver_info_to_xmlrpc): Actually store
	the contents of the RCResolverInfo message in the "message" field
	of the xmlrpc struct.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (append_dep_info): Call
	rc_resolver_info_type_to_string instead of _to_str.
	(dep_get_package_info_cb): Call
	rc_resolver_info_packages_to_string instead of to_str.

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_rc_resolver_info_to_xmlrpc): Changed to call

2002-08-08  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_get_proxy): We can get back a NULL

	* rcd.c (option_parsing): If the RCD_NON_DAEMON environment
	variable is set, act as if the --non-daemon option was used.

	* rcd-identity.c (rcd_identity_update_password_file): When I fixed
	this bug the other day, I only fixed it half-way... we need to
	also handle the case of an file that is empty or contains only
	comments.

2002-08-07  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (cleanup_after_transaction): Don't free
	log_tid since rcd_transact_log_send_success() will free it.

	packages_to_download list.

2002-08-07  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-about.c (rcd_about_copyright): Removed "All rights reserved"
	as we're not reserving all of our rights (since it's licensed
	under the GPL).

2002-08-07  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-system.c (system_ping): Send the server's major, minor
	and micro version information back in response to the ping.  This
	way clients don't need to parse the "name" field to figure out
	what version of rcd they are talking to.

2002-08-06  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-privileges.c (rcd_privileges_from_string): Properly handle
	the case of a superuser privileges mixed in with lower-level
	privileges.  This lets us actually add superuser-level users
	through rc.

2002-08-06  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (verify_packages): Set the keyring.

	so slowly.)

2002-08-06  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: remove references to libredcarpet, red_carpet_libs,
	etc

2002-08-06  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>
	
	* rcd.c (daemonize): Reopen stdout and stderr to
	/var/log/rcd/rcd-messages.  If /var/log/rcd doesn't exist, create

	/var/log/rcd/rcd-package-history.
	(rcd_open_log_file): If /var/log/rcd doesn't exist, create it.

2002-08-06  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-fetch.c: Split out a bunch of the transfer queuing and
	beginning to smaller functions.

	* rcd-rpc.c:
	* rcd-unix-server.c:
	* rcd.c: Change around a lot of the debug levels so that our
	/tmp/rcd-messages file isn't hundreds and hundreds of megs by
	default.

2002-08-05  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-module.h: Added version, interface_major, and
	interface_minor fields.

	* rcd-module.c (rcd_module_query): Take required_major and

	* Makefile.am: Install rcd-buddy into PREFIX/share/rcd and make it

	/tmp/rcd-crash.PID.
	
	* rcd.c (main): Handle SIGSEGV, SIGFPE and SIGBUS with
	crash_handler.
	(crash_handler): If we can find it, run rcd-buddy.

2002-08-02  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_register): Don't do any checks here; do
	them all in rcd.c.  Call uname() to get the hostname, and send it
	along on the query string with the orgtoken.  Use the standard
	host to get it, don't use a special registration host.  Get the
	X-RC-Status header from the server to determine if we've
	successfully registered.

	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_get_registration_host): Removed.
	(rcd_prefs_get_registered): Added.

	(rcd_transfer_protocol_http_get_response_header): Pull the header
	out of our copy of headers, since the message will have been freed
	by the time we want them.

	* rcd-transfer-http.h (RCDTransferProtocolHTTP): Added a
	response_headers field.

	* rcd.c (initialize_data): Do a bunch of checks to see if we

	Removed.
	(rcd_transact_log_send_transaction): Change to use RCDTransfer
	instead of using Soup directly.  Use neat RCDTransferProtocolHTTP
	functions to set headers and do HTTP POST.
	(rcd_transact_log_send_success): Ditto.
	(transaction_sent, success_sent): Changed to be callbacks from the
	file_done signal on a RCDTransfer

	* rcd-transfer-http.c (get_mid, get_secret): Removed.
	(http_open): Set the HTTP method to the method set on the
	protocol, instead of always SOUP_METHOD_GET.  If we don't have a
	cache associated with this transfer, don't try to cache it
	anywhere.  Call add_header_cb() for every header we have.
	(add_header_cb): Added.  Adds the headers from the
	RCDTransferProtocolHTTP to the SoupMessage.
	(http_get_local_filename): Make this static.
	(http_free): Added.  Frees the headers.
	(rcd_transfer_protocol_http_set_method): Added.  Sets the HTTP
	method to use for a transfer.
	(rcd_transfer_protocol_http_set_request_body): Added.  Sets the
	body for a HTTP request.
	(rcd_transfer_protocol_http_set_request_header): Added.  Sets a
	header for a HTTP request.
	(rcd_transfer_protocol_http_get_response_header): Added.  Gets a
	header from a HTTP response.

	* rcd-transfer.c (rcd_transfer_finalize): Free the protocol.
	(rcd_transfer_new): Add a URL parameter here and create the

	(rcd_transfer_begin): Drop the URL parameter.
	(rcd_transfer_begin_blocking): Drop the URL parameter.

	* rcd-transfer.h (RCDTransferProtocol): Add a free_func element,
	which will allow RCDTransferProtocol implementations to free their
	extra data as well as themselves.

	* rcd-transfer-http.c (http_done): When pulling from the cache,
	create a new RCDTransferProtocol structure and set the URL and
	filename and call rcd_transfer_begin().g1
	
	(http_info): Get the X-RC-Auth header, if it's there, and store it
	in the static variable.
	(http_open): Send the X-RC-Auth header, if present, with any
	request.

2002-08-01  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* rcd-query-packages.c (needs_upgrade_match): only get upgrades in
	subscribed channels

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (build_updates_list): no need to filter out
	upgrades from unsubscribed channels, because we won't get them
	anymore

2002-07-31  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd.c (option_parsing): Added late-background option to options
	table.
	(debug_message_handler): Moved the static PID variable out of the
	function (and renamed it slightly) so that we won't keep using the
	parent's PID if we daemonize late.
	(daemonize): Actually set /tmp/rcd-messages so that it is
	O_WRONLY.  That allows us to actually write stuff to it. :)
	(main): Support late-backgrounding.  This requires us to change
	the order of things slightly.
	(hello): Broke out the few lines of code that print the greeting
	so that we don't have to duplicate them for late-backgrounding in
	main.  Added printing the time, because that just seemed like a
	nice thing to print.

	* rcd-log.c (rcd_log_reinit): Added.  A small hack to help support
	--late-background.

	* rcd-rpc.c (rcd_rpc_register_method): Make the "Registering
	method foo" message level DEBUG, not INFO.

2002-07-31  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (download_packages): Don't call g_file_test()
	if the package filename is NULL.

	* rcd-transact-log.c (manifest_xml_node): Drop the URL argument.
	Only send update info if we have an update associated with our
	package.
	(transaction_xml): If we don't have a channel, send along -1, drop
	the RCPackageUpdate from the call to manifest_xml_node().
	(rcd_transact_log_send_transaction): Fix a double free.

2002-07-30  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (cleanup_after_transaction): Added.  Cleans up
	the package cache if persistent caching is turned off, and allows
	shutdowns again.
	(run_transaction, verify_packages, download_completed): Call
	cleanup_after_transaction().
	(verify_packages): Change to take an RCDTransactionStatus instead
	of a non-descript gpointer.  Now a void function.

2002-07-30  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd.c (initialize_rc_world): Added a shutdown handler that frees
	the world.  This keeps all of the world memory from showing up as
	reachable when we are using valgrind.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_dump): Assemble extra information
	about the system (rcd version, time of day, hostname, etc.) and
	stick in into our world dump.

	Checks the configuation file to see if we should run an HTTPS
	server.

	the config file.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (verify_packages): If verification fails,
	allow shutdown again.
	(download_completed): Added, but incomplete.  If the download
	failed, send it down to the client and allow shutdowns again.  If
	it succeeds, call verify_packages().
	(download_packages): Set download_completed() to be the download
	completion callback instead of verify_packages().
	(packsys_transact): If we're in premium mode, send a transaction
	manifest to the server for logging.

	* rcd-rpc.c (run_server_thread): Removed; moved all of this into
	rcd_rpc_server_start().
	(rcd_rpc_server_start): Take a port parameter.  Start the HTTPS
	server if it's enabled.

	installed size if it's zero.

2002-07-28  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-recurring.c: Added.  This is a slightly over-engineered
	framework for handling recurring events.

	* rcd-heartbeat.c: Modified to use the new framework for recurring
	events in rcd-recurring.c.

2002-07-26  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: Change the moduledir to be $(libdir)/rcd/modules so
	we don't try to load the RPM and dpkg stubs as modules.

	* rcd-rpc.c (access_control_check): Check to make sure method_info
	is valid before we dereference its privileges.
	
2002-07-25  Frank Belew  <frb@ximian.com>

	* rcd.c (root_check): Removed a FIXME that didn't really need
	fixing.

	* rcd-rpc-prefs.c (rcd_rpc_prefs_register_methods): Removed a
	FIXME; superuser is probably the right privilege level for
	set_prefs.

	* rcd-log.c (rcd_log): Removed a FIXME that didn't really need
	fixing.

	* rcd-log-entry.c (rcd_log_entry_parse): Skip log lines that

	(conn_accept): And add it here, after we add the watch.

2002-07-23  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_get_heartbeat_interval): Set the default
	heartbeat interval to 21600 (6 hours).

	calling getsockopt().  This should fix the occassional
	authentication problems on unix sockets.

2002-07-22  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-pending.c (rcd_pending_cleanup): Re-enabled pending
	cleanup... the problem was not with this code.

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_channel): The ChannelFetchClosure needs
	to hold a reference to the channel.  This fixes a bug which was
	causing us to segfault when repeatedly refreshing the channel
	data.
	(process_channel_cb): Release the closure's reference on the
	channel.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (refresh_channels_cb): Set id_list to NULL

	600 after we re-open it.

2002-07-21  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-pending.c (rcd_pending_cleanup): There seems to be some
	problem with the cleanup function (memory corruption), so I'm
	disabling it for now.

	* rcd-unix-server.c (rcd_unix_server_run_async): If our
	attempt to unlink the old socket path fails when we start up,
	the permission are probably wrong and our attempt to start
	rcd will most likely fail... so print a warning message that
	says so.

	* rcd-rpc.c (run_server_thread): Turn a g_error into
	an rc_debug and an exit.

	* rcd-transfer-http.c (http_done): Use my
	RCD_SOUP_MESSAGE_IS_ERROR() macro instead of the one in Soup,

	errors.	

2002-07-19  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-util.h: Add RCD_RPC_FAULT_CANT_AUTHENTICATE, which is

	the work.

2002-07-17  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_rc_package_from_xmlrpc_package): If we don't
	have a channel associated, first check to see if the
	"package_data" key is set, because then we know it's actually a
	streamed package.  Else check for a "package_filename" key,
	because then we know it's actually a reference to a local file.
	Otherwise, check for system packages like usual.

2002-07-16  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_get_proxy): Added.

	* rcd-transfer-http.c (http_done): Split out the mapping of Soup

2002-07-15  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* gnome-config.c: Remove an unused function to avoid a compiler

	querystring if present as well as the path for things like

	merge the broken paths we build in libredcarpet so we always
	download the right thing.

	one.

2002-07-12  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>
