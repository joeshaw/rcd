	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_rc_package_to_xmlrpc): If name_installed >
	0, this package has a greater version number than the installed
	package with the same name.  If name_installed < 0, the installed
	version is newer.

2002-09-11  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd.c (initialize_data): We always have to register before we
	ever download any channel data.  Don't know what crack I was
	smoking.

2002-09-11  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-query-packages.c (package_installed_match): Added.  This is
	a query method that returns true if the package is a system
	package or is an in-channel package that has the same EVR as a
	system package.
	Also created an entry in the query_packages_engine array for
	"package-installed".

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_rc_package_to_xmlrpc): Added a name_installed
	field to the package xml-rpc struct.  It is a flag that gets set
	if a package of the same name is installed on the system.

2002-09-10  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-autopull.c (rcd_autopull_resolve_and_transact): Update for
	the rcd_transaction_begin() API change.

	* rcd-cache.c (rcd_cache_entry_close): g_strdup() the filename
	before adding it as the key to the hash table.
	(rcd_cache_new): Call g_hash_table_new_full() and pass in g_free()
	as the key destroy func.

	* rcd-fetch.c: Get rid of package_transfer_id, we'll be using the
	download pending id now instead.
	(rcd_fetch_packages): Don't return a download id, take in the
	pending_id as an argument.

	* rcd-pending.c (rcd_pending_get_error_msg): Added.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_transact): Update for the new
	rcd_transaction_begin() API.  Return a tuple of download pending
	id, transaction pending id, and transaction step pending id.
	(packsys_abort_download): Offload the work into
	rcd-transaction.c where it should be.

	* rcd-rpc-system.c (system_poll_pending): Set error_msg on the
	xmlrpc struct if it's set on the pending object.

	* rcd-transaction.c (RCDTransactionStatus): Use three pendings
	instead of one and a generic download id.
	(rcd_transaction_status_unref): Unref all of our pendings.

	messages to the transaction_pending.
	(transact_progress_cb): Update the transaction_step_pending
	progress.

	rcd_pending_fail() call.  Get rid of the "failed" message.
	(run_transaction): Pass transaction_pending into
	fail_transaction().
	(verify_packages): Start transaction_pending.  Get rid
	of the "failed" message; rcd_pending_fail() is sufficient.
	(download_completed): call rcd_pending_finished() on
	download_pending if we're successful.  Otherwise abort or fail it.
	(download_packages): Create download_pending and begin
	it if we have packages to download.  Pass the id into
	rcd_fetch_packages().
	(rcd_transaction_begin): Make it a void function, take three out
	parameters which are for the download_pending id,
	transaction_pending id, and transaction_step_pending id.
	(check_install_auth): Takes an RCDTransactionStatus object and an
	RCDIdentity and determines if the identity has the authorization
	to cancel the download for the transaction.
	(rcd_transaction_abort): Added.  Given a download_id and an
	identity, abort the transaction if we can.

2002-09-10  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-autopull.c: Added name field to RCDAutopull struct.

	* rcd-rpc-prefs.c (rcd_rpc_prefs_register_methods): Register the
	prefs so clients can set them.

2002-09-06  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-cache.c: Key all cache entries by the local cache filename,
	not the URL.  This way we can do lookups based on the local
	filename, and files should be cached across hosts in the same
	session.
	(rcd_cache_entry_invalidate): Added.  Invalidates a cache entry.

	* rcd-privileges.c (rcd_privileges_init): Added a "trusted"
	privilege to the base privileges.

	* rcd-transaction.c (RCDTransactionStatus): Replace a client_user
	field with an RCDIdentity field.
	(verify_packages): Check to see if we have the trusted privilege
	before we install packages without (or with an inconclusive) GPG
	signature.
	(rcd_transaction_begin): We need to call verify_packages() even if
	we're not downloading anything.  Take an RCDIdentity argument
	instead of a const char * for the username.
	(check_package_integrity): Added.  Runs a size and md5sum
	verification on a package in the attempt to see if it's a valid
	package file.
	(dowwnload_packages): If the file already exists on the local
	filesystem, run a integrity check on it.  If it fails, invalidate
	it from the cache (if appropriate) and require it be downloaded
	again.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_transact): Pass in the identity
	instead of just the identity's username to
	rcd_transaction_begin().

	* rcd-autopull.c (rcd_autopull_resolve_and_transact): Create a
	dummy identity to pass into rcd_transaction_begin().

2002-09-05  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc.c (rcd_rpc_server_start): Use HTTP digest authentication
	for client-daemon TCP connections.

2002-09-05  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (what_requires_or_conflicts_cb): Don't do
	anything if a fault has occured.
	(packsys_what_requires): Be more careful about checking for xmlrpc
	faults.

	if the passed-in ID is <= 0.

2002-09-04  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_rc_channel_to_xmlrpc): Add the channel's
	description to the xml-rpc struct.

2002-09-03  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-prefs.c: The config file is now rcd.conf, to be more
	consistent with every other daemon configuration file.

	* rcd-identity.c: The ACL/password file is now rcd.passwd, to be more
	consistent with rcd.conf.

2002-09-03  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_rc_package_to_xmlrpc): Include the file
	size, installed size, and section info when we map an RCPackage to
	an xml-rpc struct.
	(rcd_rc_package_to_xmlrpc): We also need the section's user
	string.

2002-08-29  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd.c (is_supported_distro): Added.  Checks to see if we're on a
	supported distro and prints a warning to the logs if we're not.
	(initialize_data): Don't try to download a channel list or channel
	data if we're on an unsupported distribution.

2002-08-29  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_set_proxy_url,
	rcd_prefs_get_proxy_username, rcd_prefs_get_proxy_password): If
	the string coming in is NULL, unset the key rather than trying to
	set it to NULL (which doesn't work).

	* rcd-rpc-prefs.c (get_string_func): Use RC_STRING_TO_XMLRPC() so
	we don't pass in NULL to xmlrpc_build_value().
	(set_string_func): Use XMLRPC_STRING_TO_RC() so we get back NULL
	if the string is empty.

2002-08-28  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (prepend_pkg): Use the
	rc_package_status_is_to_be_installed macro.

	* rcd-autopull.c (pkg_install): Use the
	rc_package_status_is_to_be_installed macro.

2002-08-28  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-prefs.c: Add get/set preferences for the three proxy
	elements: URL, username, password.

	* rcd-rpc-prefs.c: Add privileges for getting and setting
	individual preferences.
	(RCDPrefTable): Add RCDPrivileges fields for getting and setting
	prefs.
	(get_pref): Get the method data and approve the get against the
	user's identity.
	(prefs_set_pref): Get the method data and approve the set against
	the user's identity.
	(prefs_list_prefs): Do a get_pref() on each pref and add it to the
	list if the user has privileges to see it.  When we're done, if it
	turns out the list of preferences the user can see is empty, throw
	a permission denied fault instead of returning an empty list.
	(rcd_rpc_prefs_register_pref_full, rcd_rpc_prefs_register_pref):
	Take a list of privileges for getting and setting a pref.
	(rcd_rpc_prefs_register_methods): Register the proxy prefs, and
	fix up all of the other prefs to have individual privileges.  Make
	the RPC calls approve anyone (since handling is done inside the
	calls now).

2002-08-28  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (build_updates_list): use
	rc_packman_version_compare, not rc_package_spec_compare

	* rcd.c (initialize_rc_world): no more rc_packman_set_packman or
	rc_world_register_packman, rc_world_new needs a packman, and
	rc_set_world that

2002-08-27  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transfer-http.c
	(rcd_transfer_protocol_http_get_response_body): Removed.  It's not
	used anywhere anymore, and since we overwrite chunks, it'll never
	work the way we want it to.

2002-08-27  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-autopull.c (rcd_autopull_resolve_and_transact): If we had
	failed deps, stringify the failure and send it as the reason
	instead of a generic "resolution failed" message.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (append_dep_info, dep_get_failure_info): Use a
	GString instead of allocating a bunch of temporary strings.

2002-08-26  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_distro): Added.  Downloads
	"distributions.xml" from the server, so we can dynamically change
	things like what distributions are supported, which are
	deprecated, etc.

	* rcd.c (main): Fix the rc_distro_parse_xml() FIXME; add a call to
	rcd_fetch_distro() to immediately before initializing the RCWorld.

	* rcd-transfer.c: Remove some errant FIXMEs.

2002-08-26  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-log.c (rcd_log_init): Remove the SIGHUP handler from here.

	* rcd.c (daemonize): Add some asserts so we can be sure that we're
	reopening std* correctly.
	(main): Add a SIGHUP handler.
	(sighup_handler): Added.  Closes and reopens stdout and stderr,
	reinitializes the log, and adds a reload of all the channel data
	to an idle loop.

2002-08-26  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_register): Get the contents of the transfer
	from the GByteArray returned from rcd_transfer_begin_blocking()
	instead of from the protocol backend.

2002-08-23  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_get_channel_icon): Um, close the file
	after we're done with it.

2002-08-23  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-cache.c (RCDCache): Add a user_data field.
	(icon_cache_filename_func): Added.  Munges an icon filename.
	(rcd_cache_get_icon_cache): Added.  Gets the icon cache and sets
	the channel_id as the cache's user_data.

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_channel): Fix a leak when downloading
	channel data fails.
	(rcd_fetch_channel_icon): Fetches the channel icon.
	(rcd_fetch_all_channel_icons): Fetches all of the channel icons,
	or only the ones that need to be fetched.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_refresh_channel): Also refresh the
	channel's icon.
	(refresh_channels_cb): Refresh all of the channel icons.
	(packsys_get_channel_icon): Added.  Sends the channel icon down
	the wire.
	(rcd_rpc_packsys_register_methods): Register get_channel_icon().

	* rcd-rpc-system.c: Add an #include to avoid a warning.

	* rcd-rpc-util.h: Add RCD_RPC_FAULT_NO_ICON fault.

	* rcd.c (initialize_data): Download the channel icons that we
	don't already have on disk.

2002-08-23  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-unix-server.c: Include sys/time.h, which is needed so that
	we pick up the definition of struct timeval on machines running an
	older glibc (like RH62).

	* rcd.c (option_parsing): Don't use the POPT_TABLEEND macro, since
	it isn't in the version of popt that comes with RH62.

2002-08-22  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-unix-server.c (SOCKET_PATH): Change from /tmp/rcd to
	/var/run/rcd to conform to the FHS.

2002-08-22  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transaction.c (rcd_transaction_send_log): Drop the
	logversion from the URL, Aidan says we don't need it.

2002-08-22  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: Remove rcd-transact-log.[ch].

	* rcd-transaction.c: Fold in the transaction logging into here,
	where it belongs.  Greatly simplify so it only makes one trip to
	the server instead of two.  Will depend on new logging code on the
	servers, though.  Make RCDTransactionStatus refcounted.

	* rcd-transact-log.[ch]: Removed.

	* rcd-autopull.c (rcd_autopull_resolve_and_transact): If we have
	failed dependencies, log it to the server.

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_register): Plug a leak.

2002-08-22  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-system.c (system_ping): Set server_url and
	server_premium.

	* rcd-transact-log.c (manifest_xml_node): Send the name of the
	old_pkg along as well as the EVR.

2002-08-21  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transaction.c (rcd_transaction_begin): Require client_id and
	client_version arguments which identify the client requesting the
	transaction.
	(cleanup_after_transaction): Free the client_id and client_version
	when we're done.

	* rcd-transact-log.c (rcd_transact_log_send_transaction): Take the
	client_id and client_version as arguments, pass them into
	transaction_xml().
	(transaction_xml): Take the client_id and client_version and add
	them to the XML.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_transact): Take the client ID and
	client version as the fourth and fifth arguments and pass them
	into rcd_transaction_begin().

	* rcd-autopull.c (rcd_autopull_resolve_and_transact): Add
	client_id and client_version arguments to rcd_transaction_begin.

2002-08-21  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-autopull.c: (rcd_autopull_resolve_and_transact): Actually
	handle the transaction.
	(rcd_autopull_process_xml): Try to get the check-in interval from
	the XML.
	(xml_fetch_next): Use the check-in interval.
	(rcd_autopull_download_xml): Actually download the autopull XML.
	(xml_fetch_execute): Disable the file override.
	(rcd_autopull_resolve_and_transact): Be a bit more verbose in our
	logging.

2002-08-21  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_channel_list): Return a gboolean
	indicating success.  Before we add the channels from the XML,
	remove all of the previous channels.  Before, this was done before
	every call to rcd_fetch_channel_list().  Now, if we fail, we can
	just continue using what we already had in memory.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (refresh_channels_cb): Don't remove the
	channels from the world here, that's now done in
	rcd_fetch_channel_list() on success.  If fetching the channel list
	fails, set an invalid indicator.
	(packsys_refresh_all_channels): If we get an invalid list back
	from refresh_channels_cb(), set a fault.

	* rcd-rpc-util.h: Added RCD_RPC_FAULT_CANT_REFRESH.

	* rcd-transfer-http.c (http_read_data): If the HTTP response isn't
	in the 200 class, don't try to append data to the (unopened) cache
	entry.  Fixes a g_warning().

2002-08-21  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-autopull.c: Further hacking.  We are now pretty close to
	having autopull actually work.

2002-08-20  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd.c (main): Fixed memory leak.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (resolve_deps): OK, I didn't fully understand
	the semantics of the resolve_deps function before I lumbered in
	and started changing stuff.  We now properly filter the original
	install/remove requests out of the list of installs/removals that
	we return.

2002-08-20  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd.c (initialize_data): Don't check to see if we've registered
	previously.  Always try to register.
	(crash_handler): We can't just set SIG_DFL as the second argument;
	we have to create a struct sigaction with SIG_DFL as the
	sa_handler.

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_register): If we couldn't successfully
	register, send a warning out to the logs with a reason.

	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_{get|set}_registered): Removed.

	* rcd-transfer-http.c (http_done): Set the protocol's response
	body to whatever the server sends back.
	(http_free): Free the response_body.
	(rcd_transfer_protocol_http_get_response_body): Added.

2002-08-20  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c: Ugh... there was some deeply broken code in
	here.
	(prepend_pkg): Go back to just appending packages to a list,
	instead of trying to do fancy hash stuff.  Use the
	rc_package_status_is_to_be_uninstalled and rc_package_is_installed
	functions to check the status... looking directly inside of the
	structs is unreliable and will give you the wrong answer in some
	cases.
	(prepend_pkg_pair): Just append packages to a list, instead of
	trying to do fancy hash stuff.
	(remove_duplicate_packages): Given a list of packages, remove any
	duplicates.  Yes, this function is O(N^2)... but it has the
	decided advantage of actually being correct. :)
	(resolve_deps): Remove all of the hash cleverness, and just go
	back to accumulating our packages in lists.  The main problem was
	that the hashes were keyed on the package spec's quark...  but
	that is dangerously broken, since multiple packages with the same
	name can appear in the install/remove lists in some cases.

	* rcd.c (crash_handler): Restore the default SIGSEGV, SIGFPE and
	SIGBUS handlers after we enter our crash handler.  This makes our
	crash handling somewhat less flaky.

2002-08-19  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-autopull.c: Further hacking.

2002-08-17  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_world_sequence_number): A method that
	returns the world's sequence number.
	(rcd_rpc_packsys_register_methods): Register the seqno method.

2002-08-14  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (resolve_packages): get rid of all of the
	virtual conflicts stuff

2002-08-14  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: Don't make rcd-buddy executable in the
	install-data-hook.

	* rcd.c (crash_handler): Invoke rcd-buddy as "python
	SHAREDIR/rcd-buddy".  Don't stat to check if the rcd-buddy is
	there, since we now do that check before seting up the crash
	handler.
	(main): Don't set up the crash handler if we can't find python in
	the path.

2002-08-13  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (packsys_transact): Expire the package
	cache before every transaction.

	* rcd-expire.c (rcd_expire_unlink): Added.  A static function that
	just wraps unlink and produces some debug spew.
	(expire_by_age_cb): Use rcd_expire_unlink.
	(rcd_expire_by_size): Use rcd_expire_unlink.

	* rcd-cache.c (rcd_cache_expire_package_cache): A convenience
	function to expire the package cache using the cache-related
	preferences as parameters.
	(rcd_cache_get_package_cache): When we create the package cache,
	register a shutdown handler that expires the cache.

2002-08-13  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* rcd-log-entry.c (rcd_log_entry_parse): fix a crash, argh

2002-08-12  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-cache.c (rcd_cache_expire): Added.  Finds the directory the
	RCDCache stores files in and cleans them up by age and size.

	* rcd-rpc-prefs.c (rcd_rpc_prefs_register_methods): Register our
	cache expiration preferences.

	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_get_cache_cleanup_enabled): Added.
	(rcd_prefs_set_cache_cleanup_enabled): Added.
	(rcd_prefs_get_cache_max_age_in_days): Added.
	(rcd_prefs_set_cache_max_age_in_days): Added.
	(rcd_prefs_get_cache_max_size_in_mb): Added.
	(rcd_prefs_set_cache_max_size_in_mb): Added.

	* rcd-expire.c: Added.  Some general code for cleaning up cached
	files by size and age.

2002-08-12  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-query-packages.c (name_installed_match): Added.  Returns
	TRUE if any package matching a name is installed.
	(query_packages_engine): Added "name-installed".

2002-08-12  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transaction.c (download_packages): Return an int instead of
	a gboolean.  If we have packages to download, check to make sure
	we have the disk space to store them.  Otherwise, lose it.
	Returns the number of packages to download now.

2002-08-12  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_get_cache_dir): Change the cache dir to
	/var/cache/redcarpet.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (refresh_channels_cb): Move the transaction
	lock call here so the heartbeat locks it and we don't get
	transaction lock warnings.
	(packsys_refresh_all_channels): Remove the lock call from here.

2002-08-09  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-cache.c (rcd_cache_lookup): If the file isn't there anymore,
	remove the cache entry from the cache before freeing it.  Duh.

	* rcd-transact-log.c (rcd_transact_log_send_transaction): Since
	it's very possible for a transaction to finish before the
	transaction manifest is even sent to the server, we need to
	allocate the transaction id slot on the heap.  Change this
	function to return a newly allocated slot for it.  God, this code
	is really nasty.  It should be integrated with rcd-transaction.c.
	(transaction_sent): If rcd_transact_log_send_success() got called
	before we did, free the tid slot.
	(success_sent): Free the tid and the slot.

	now.
	(rcd_transaction_begin): Assign status->log_tid to the result of

	* rcd-log-entry.c (spec_to_str): RCPackageSpec GQuark fixup
	(spec_from_str): GQuark fixup.  This function is so screwed.  It
	claims to take const char * parameters, and then uses those to
	populate a structure that, when freed, will free them.  Odd.
	(rcd_log_entry_parse): GQuark fixup.

	* rcd-log.c (package_name_match): GQuark fixup

	* rcd-query-packages.c (name_match): GQuark fixup

	* rcd-cache.c: Fix some cache contention issues...
	(rcd_cache_entry_new): Don't insert the cache entry into the cache
	immediately.
	(rcd_cache_entry_open): Instead of saving to package.tmp, use
	g_mkstemp(), and save the temporary filename in the cache entry.
	(rcd_cache_entry_close): Rename the file into place and insert it
	into the cache.
	(rcd_cache_entry_free): Free the temp filename.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (fail_transaction): Added.  Split out of

	a locking error.

2002-08-08  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (resolve_deps): Added an argument for passing
	out an xmlrpc array containing the xmlrpcified RCResolverInfo
	items generated during this resolution.  It is taken from the best
	context if our resolution succeeded, and from the first failed
	queue otherwise.
	(packsys_verify_dependencies): Get the resolution info from the
	call to resolve_deps, then pass it back as the third element of
	our returned tuple.
	(packsys_resolve_dependencies): Ditto.

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_rc_resolver_info_to_xmlrpc): Actually store
	the contents of the RCResolverInfo message in the "message" field
	of the xmlrpc struct.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (append_dep_info): Call
	rc_resolver_info_type_to_string instead of _to_str.
	(dep_get_package_info_cb): Call
	rc_resolver_info_packages_to_string instead of to_str.

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_rc_resolver_info_to_xmlrpc): Changed to call

	RCPackageDeps
	(rcd_xmlrpc_to_rc_package_dep): ditto

2002-08-08  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_get_proxy): We can get back a NULL
	SoupUri from soup_uri_new(), so we need to check for that.  Blah.

2002-08-08  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_rc_resolver_info_to_xmlrpc): Added.

	variable is set, act as if the --non-daemon option was used.

	* rcd-identity.c (rcd_identity_update_password_file): When I fixed
	this bug the other day, I only fixed it half-way... we need to
	also handle the case of an file that is empty or contains only
	comments.

2002-08-07  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (cleanup_after_transaction): Don't free
	log_tid since rcd_transact_log_send_success() will free it.

	* rcd-transact-log.c (rcd_transact_log_send_transaction,
	rcd_transact_log_send_success): Fix memory leaks.

2002-08-07  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-about.c (rcd_about_copyright): Removed "All rights reserved"
	as we're not reserving all of our rights (since it's licensed
	under the GPL).

2002-08-07  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-system.c (system_ping): Send the server's major, minor
	and micro version information back in response to the ping.  This
	way clients don't need to parse the "name" field to figure out
	what version of rcd they are talking to.

2002-08-06  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-privileges.c (rcd_privileges_from_string): Properly handle
	the case of a superuser privileges mixed in with lower-level
	privileges.  This lets us actually add superuser-level users
	through rc.

2002-08-06  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (verify_packages): Set the keyring.

	* Makefile.am: remove references to libredcarpet, red_carpet_libs,
	etc

2002-08-06  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>
	
	* rcd.c (daemonize): Reopen stdout and stderr to

	/var/log/rcd/rcd-package-history.
	(rcd_open_log_file): If /var/log/rcd doesn't exist, create it.

2002-08-06  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-fetch.c: Split out a bunch of the transfer queuing and
	beginning to smaller functions.
	(package_completed_cb): Unref the transfer afterward.
	(rcd_fetch_packages_abort): Unref all of the queued transfers.

2002-08-06  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-fetch.c (download_package_file): If we want to download more
	packages than we allow concurrently, queue the additional ones up.
	(package_completed_cb): If we have any queued up
	packages to download, pop one off and begin it.

	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_get_max_downloads,
	rcd_prefs_set_max_downloads): Added.  The maximum number of
	packages that can be downloaded at one time.  0 means unlimited.

	* rcd-rpc.c:
	* rcd-unix-server.c:
	* rcd.c: Change around a lot of the debug levels so that our
	/tmp/rcd-messages file isn't hundreds and hundreds of megs by
	default.

2002-08-05  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-recurring.[ch]: Fix the license.

2002-08-05  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-module.h: Added version, interface_major, and
	interface_minor fields.

	* rcd-module.c (rcd_module_query): Take required_major and

	way we iterate over the deps, since they're arrays now

	* rcd-rpc-util.h, rcd-rpc-util.c: change
	rcd_rc_package_dep_slist_to_xmlrpc to
	rcd_rc_package_dep_array_to_xmlrpc.

2002-08-05  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am (install-data-hook): chmod rcd-buddy in the correct
	hook.

2002-08-05  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: get rid of the rcd-marshal.[ch] stamp stuff

2002-08-05  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd.c (main): Only set up the crash handlers if it looks
	like rcd-buddy is actually in the right place.

	* Makefile.am (rcd_buddy_DATA): Added rcd-buddy-cmds.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Added rcd-buddy and rcd-buddy-cmds.

	* rcd-buddy-cmds: A file with the commands that rcd-buddy feeds

	* Makefile.am: Install rcd-buddy into PREFIX/share/rcd and make it
	executable.

	* rcd-buddy: Added.  A little python script that runs gdb,
	attaches to a crashing rcd process, and dumps the backtrace into
	/tmp/rcd-crash.PID.
	
	* rcd.c (main): Handle SIGSEGV, SIGFPE and SIGBUS with
	crash_handler.
	(crash_handler): If we can find it, run rcd-buddy.

	* rcd-autopull.c: Added.  The beginnings of some code for an
	autopull module.  Still incomplete.

	* rcd-module.c (rcd_module_init): Please don't leak the GDir.

	* rcd-identity.c (create_password_file): Added.  Breaks out our
	fopen/chmod on PASSWORD_FILE.
	(identity_update_cb): Changed to use create_password_file.
	(rcd_identity_update_password_file): If our password file doesn't
	already exist, create it and then go ahead and do the right thing.

2002-08-03  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* rcd-fetch.c (get_channel_list_url): no need to call
	rc_figure_distro, etc anymore, just check rc_distro_get_target

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (extra_dump_info): no rc_figure_distro, access
	the distro name, version, and target directly

	* rcd-rpc-system.c (system_ping): no rc_figure_distro, access
	name, version, and target directly

	* rcd-transact-log.c (transaction_xml): no rc_figure_distro,
	access target directly

	* rcd.c (main): as a HACK, call rc_distro_parse_xml (NULL, 0) to
	initialize the distribution with the internal distribution XML.
	This needs to eventually download and parse a distribution XML
	file, but we need to discuss how best to do that.

2002-08-02  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (append_dep_info): Fixed memory leak.

	* rcd-rpc.c (access_control_check): Fixed memory leak.

2002-08-02  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_register): Don't do any checks here; do
	them all in rcd.c.  Call uname() to get the hostname, and send it
	along on the query string with the orgtoken.  Use the standard
	host to get it, don't use a special registration host.  Get the
	X-RC-Status header from the server to determine if we've
	successfully registered.

	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_get_registration_host): Removed.
	(rcd_prefs_get_registered): Added.
	(rcd_prefs_set_registered): Added.

	http_debug_post_handler): Output an ungodly amount of HTTP
	debugging info.
	(http_done): Copy the response headers into our own copy, since
	Soup will automatically free them when we exit this function.
	(http_open): Call http_debug().
	(http_free): Free our response headers as well.
	(rcd_transfer_protocol_http_get_response_header): Pull the header
	out of our copy of headers, since the message will have been freed
	by the time we want them.

	* rcd-transfer-http.h (RCDTransferProtocolHTTP): Added a
	response_headers field.

	* rcd.c (initialize_data): Do a bunch of checks to see if we
	should register.

2002-08-02  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd.c (rcd_create_uuid): Added.  Creates a uuid file (like the

	Removed.
	(rcd_transact_log_send_transaction): Change to use RCDTransfer
	instead of using Soup directly.  Use neat RCDTransferProtocolHTTP
	functions to set headers and do HTTP POST.
	(rcd_transact_log_send_success): Ditto.
	(transaction_sent, success_sent): Changed to be callbacks from the
	file_done signal on a RCDTransfer

	* rcd-transfer-http.c (get_mid, get_secret): Removed.
	(http_open): Set the HTTP method to the method set on the
	protocol, instead of always SOUP_METHOD_GET.  If we don't have a
	cache associated with this transfer, don't try to cache it
	anywhere.  Call add_header_cb() for every header we have.
	(add_header_cb): Added.  Adds the headers from the
	RCDTransferProtocolHTTP to the SoupMessage.
	(http_get_local_filename): Make this static.
	(http_free): Added.  Frees the headers.
	(rcd_transfer_protocol_http_set_method): Added.  Sets the HTTP
	method to use for a transfer.
	(rcd_transfer_protocol_http_set_request_body): Added.  Sets the
	body for a HTTP request.

	header from a HTTP response.
	(rcd_transfer_protocol_http_new): Set the protocol free_func to
	http_free() and initialize the method to SOUP_METHOD_GET.

2002-08-01  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-transfer.c (rcd_transfer_finalize): Free the protocol.
	(rcd_transfer_new): Add a URL parameter here and create the
	RCDTransfereProtocol structure here, and set the URL and filename
	elements.
	(rcd_transfer_get_protocol_from_url): Make this non-static.
	(rcd_transfer_begin): Drop the URL parameter.
	(rcd_transfer_begin_blocking): Drop the URL parameter.

	* rcd-transfer.h (RCDTransferProtocol): Add a free_func element,
	which will allow RCDTransferProtocol implementations to free their
	extra data as well as themselves.

	* rcd-transfer-http.c (http_done): When pulling from the cache,
	create a new RCDTransferProtocol structure and set the URL and
	filename and call rcd_transfer_begin().g1
	
	(http_info): Get the X-RC-Auth header, if it's there, and store it
	in the static variable.
	(http_open): Send the X-RC-Auth header, if present, with any
	request.

	* rcd-fetch.c: Change all of the calls to rcd_transfer_new() to
	include the URL, and all the calls to
	rcd_transfer_begin[_blocking]() to not have a URL parameter.

2002-08-01  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* rcd-query-packages.c (needs_upgrade_match): only get upgrades in
	subscribed channels

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (build_updates_list): no need to filter out
	upgrades from unsubscribed channels, because we won't get them
	anymore

2002-07-31  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd.c (option_parsing): Added late-background option to options
	table.
	(debug_message_handler): Moved the static PID variable out of the
	function (and renamed it slightly) so that we won't keep using the
	parent's PID if we daemonize late.
	(daemonize): Actually set /tmp/rcd-messages so that it is
	O_WRONLY.  That allows us to actually write stuff to it. :)
	(main): Support late-backgrounding.  This requires us to change
	the order of things slightly.
	(hello): Broke out the few lines of code that print the greeting
	so that we don't have to duplicate them for late-backgrounding in
	main.  Added printing the time, because that just seemed like a
	nice thing to print.

	* rcd-log.c (rcd_log_reinit): Added.  A small hack to help support
	--late-background.

	* rcd-rpc.c (rcd_rpc_register_method): Make the "Registering
	method foo" message level DEBUG, not INFO.

2002-07-31  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	download_completed): call rcd_transact_log_send_success() with the
	transaction id when the transaction has finished.
	(download_completed): Handle cancelled downloads as well as failed
	downloads.

	* rcd-transact-log.c (success_xml): Make tid and message const.
	(rcd_transact_log_send_success): Make msg const.

2002-07-31  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (download_packages): Don't call g_file_test()
	if the package filename is NULL.

	* rcd-transact-log.c (manifest_xml_node): Drop the URL argument.
	Only send update info if we have an update associated with our
	package.
	(transaction_xml): If we don't have a channel, send along -1, drop
	the RCPackageUpdate from the call to manifest_xml_node().
	(rcd_transact_log_send_transaction): Fix a double free.

2002-07-30  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: add support for linking rcd statically

2002-07-30  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_packages): Initialize successful to
	TRUE.  Duh.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (cleanup_after_transaction): Added.  Cleans up
	the package cache if persistent caching is turned off, and allows
	shutdowns again.
	(run_transaction, verify_packages, download_completed): Call
	cleanup_after_transaction().
	(verify_packages): Change to take an RCDTransactionStatus instead
	of a non-descript gpointer.  Now a void function.

2002-07-30  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd.c (initialize_rc_world): Added a shutdown handler that frees
	the world.  This keeps all of the world memory from showing up as
	reachable when we are using valgrind.

	completion callback instead of verify_packages().
	(packsys_transact): If we're in premium mode, send a transaction

	events in rcd-recurring.c.

2002-07-26  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

2002-07-22  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcd-pending.c (rcd_pending_cleanup): Re-enabled pending
	cleanup... the problem was not with this code.

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_channel): The ChannelFetchClosure needs
	to hold a reference to the channel.  This fixes a bug which was

	data.
	(process_channel_cb): Release the closure's reference on the
	channel.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.c (refresh_channels_cb): Set id_list to NULL

	problem with the cleanup function (memory corruption), so I'm
	disabling it for now.

	* rcd-unix-server.c (rcd_unix_server_run_async): If our
	attempt to unlink the old socket path fails when we start up,
	the permission are probably wrong and our attempt to start
	rcd will most likely fail... so print a warning message that

	errors.	

2002-07-19  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-rpc-util.h: Add RCD_RPC_FAULT_CANT_AUTHENTICATE, which is

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_rc_package_from_xmlrpc_package): If we don't
	have a channel associated, first check to see if the
	"package_data" key is set, because then we know it's actually a
	streamed package.  Else check for a "package_filename" key,
	because then we know it's actually a reference to a local file.
	Otherwise, check for system packages like usual.

	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_get_proxy): Added.

	* rcd-rpc.c (process_rpc_call): Set the caller's identity.
	(rcd_rpc_get_caller_identity): Added, allows RPC calls to get

	Takes either a filename or a streamed package, queries it, and
	returns an RCPackage instance.

	they haven't been verified previously.

2002-05-30  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	grants all rights to any user who has it.

	* rcd-rpc.c (process_rpc_call): Use the new preinvoke method code
	I added to xmlrpc-c to do access control.  It's a lot cleaner, and
	you can't subvert it by using system.multicall(). :)

	before all RPC calls and sets a fault if not approved.
	(unix_rpc_call): Implement identites for Unix domain RPC calls.

2002-05-29  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcd-auth.c: Made more extensible for modules by making ACLs
	GQuark based and passing around lists of GQuarks for privileges.

	(rcd_rpc_packsys_register_methods): Register the get_channels
	method.

	* rcd-rpc-util.c (rcd_rc_channel_to_xmlrpc): Added.

	* rcd-query-packages.c: Added.  Implements package queries on top
	of the framework in rcd-query.c.

	containing the subscription information.

	* rcd-fetch.c (rcd_fetch_channel): Use

	for now.  If RCD_ENFORCE_AUTH is enabled, actually check
	privileges.

	* rcd-identity.c (rcd_identity_from_password_file): Added.  Looks
	for a user in the password file and returns an RCDIdentity with
	its username, password, and privileges.

	* rcd-rpc.c (rcd_rpc_init): Initialize a hash table for storing
	method info.
	(rcd_rpc_register_method): Take an RCDAuthAction parameter
	specifying the privileges required to call this method.  Add
	method info to the hash table.
	(soup_rpc_callback): Authenticate the user from HTTP Basic auth
	against an RCDIdentity from the password file.  Then look up the
