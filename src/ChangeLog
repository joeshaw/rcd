	* rcd.c: Added stuff to download channel and package info and to
	use a debug display handler.  Removed some old testing code.

	* rcd-transfer.c: Poked at the various bits of rc_debug-ism.

	* rcd-fetch.c: Added.  Some code for downloading channel and
	package information and storing it in the RCWorld.

	* rcd-cache.c (rcd_cache_open): Don't free cache_fn and tmp_fn
	until we've finished using them.

	* rcd-module.c: Changed to use rc_debug for spew.

	* rcd-prefs.c (rcd_prefs_get_cache_dir): Use a cache file under
	/tmp for now, so there is less warning spew when not running as
	root.

	* Makefile.am: Add in rcd-rpc-packsys.[ch], rcd-rpc-util.[ch],
	rcd-unix-server.[ch]: Added these.

	* rcd-rpc.c (unix_rpc_callback): Handle an XML-RPC callback over
	unix domain sockets.
	(rpc_callback, default_callback): Prefix these functions with
	"soup_"
	(server_init): Removed this function, it wasn't long enough to be
	useful.
	(run_server_thread): Move the contents of server_init() here, add
	a call to rcd_unix_server_run_async() for handling requests over
	unix domain sockets.

	* rcd-rpc.h: Move header includes inside of the only-include-once
	#ifdef magic.

	* rcd-rpc-packsys.[ch]: Added.  Contains packaging system RPC
	calls (just query for now).

	* rcd-rpc-util.[ch]: Added.  Contains utility functions for
	converting an RCPackage or RCPackageSList to XML-RPC values and
	XML-RPC values into RCDQueryParts.

	* rcd-unix-server.[ch]: Added.  Lame first cut at doing XML-RPC
	calls over unix domain sockets.

	* rcd.c (initialize_rc_world): Register the packaging system RPC
	methods.

	* Makefile.am: Lots of magic

	* rcd-module.c: Added dynamic module loading.

	* rcd-rpc.c:
	* rcd-rpc-system.c:
	* rcd-rpc-sample.c: Added RPC framework with a sample module
	implementation and some system functions (query_module, ping,
	etc.)

	* rcd.c: Initialize the module loader, run a main loop.
