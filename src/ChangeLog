	* rcd-rpc.c (process_rpc_call): Set the caller's identity.
	(rcd_rpc_get_caller_identity): Added, allows RPC calls to get

	grants all rights to any user who has it.

	* rcd-rpc.c (process_rpc_call): Use the new preinvoke method code
	I added to xmlrpc-c to do access control.  It's a lot cleaner, and
	you can't subvert it by using system.multicall(). :)

	before all RPC calls and sets a fault if not approved.
	(unix_rpc_call): Implement identites for Unix domain RPC calls.

	method.

	for now.  If RCD_ENFORCE_AUTH is enabled, actually check
	privileges.

	* rcd-identity.c (rcd_identity_from_password_file): Added.  Looks
	for a user in the password file and returns an RCDIdentity with
	its username, password, and privileges.

	* rcd-rpc.c (rcd_rpc_init): Initialize a hash table for storing
	method info.
	(rcd_rpc_register_method): Take an RCDAuthAction parameter
	specifying the privileges required to call this method.  Add
	method info to the hash table.
