To build this bad boy, you'll need glib2, a glib2-based soup, and the
xmlrpc-c library with a libxml2-backend patch applied to it.  Whee!

* Soup

  Check out the soup-0-7 branch of soup from GNOME CVS.  Configure
  with the --enable-glib2 option and install it in some funky prefix.
  It cannot (yet) be installed in the same prefix as a glib 1.2-based
  build.  I'll have to fix this, and it will probably result in all of
  the libraries being renamed.  Sigh.

* xmlrpc-c

  Get the xmlrpc-c 0.9.10 tarball from /nfs/users/joe/xmlrpc-c and
  untar it.  Apply the patch also in /nfs/users/joe/xmlrpc-c, and do
  the following:

      libtoolize --force --copy
      aclocal
      autoheader
      automake --gnu
      autoconf
      ./configure --prefix=/opt/rcd --enable-libxml2-backend \
         --disable-abyss-server --disable-cgi-server \
	 --disable-cplusplus --disable-libwww-client

And now you're ready to build RCD.  Yes, this will get fixed in the
future, if even just by having packages for this stuff.
