To build this bad boy, you'll need glib2, a glib2-based soup, and the
xmlrpc-c library with a libxml2-backend patch applied to it.  Whee!

* Soup

  Check out the soup-0-7 branch of soup from GNOME CVS.  Configure
  with the --enable-glib2 option and install it in some funky prefix.
  It cannot (yet) be installed in the same prefix as a glib 1.2-based
  build.  I'll have to fix this, and it will probably result in all of
  the libraries being renamed.  Sigh.

* xmlrpc-c

  Get the xmlrpc-c 0.9.10 tarball from /nfs/users/joe/xmlrpc-c and
  untar it.  Apply the patch also in /nfs/users/joe/xmlrpc-c, and do
  the following:

      libtoolize --force --copy
      aclocal
      autoheader
      automake --gnu
      autoconf
      ./configure --prefix=/opt/rcd --enable-libxml2-backend \
         --disable-abyss-server --disable-cgi-server \
	 --disable-cplusplus --disable-libwww-client

And now you're ready to build RCD.  Yes, this will get fixed in the
future, if even just by having packages for this stuff.

* Python module

In the python directory there is an xmlrpclib.py file, which is a fork
of the XML-RPC module that comes with Python.  This version supports
HTTP Basic authentication and raw communication over Unix domain
sockets.  To load this module instead of the default one, do something
like:

	PYTHONPATH=/cvs/rcd/python python

and then you can just "import xmlrpclib" and the correct one will be
loaded.
