CONTRIBUTING
------------
Contributors to rcd are more than welcome.  Patches should be sent to
rc-devel@lists.ximian.com.  Patches should follow the existing
stylistic conventions in rcd, should be accompanied with a ChangeLog,
and should be sent in GNU unified diff format (diff -u).

Please DO NOT commit to CVS without approval from one of the
maintainers.

BUILDING
--------
Building rcd is hard.  Like, a total pain in the ass.  Hopefully we
will soon have development packages up so you don't have to go
through the hell of building this stuff yourself.

* glib 2

  First, you will need glib2.  It comes with Red Hat 7.3 and up, and
  probably every distro after.  If you don't have it, you can get it
  from http://www.gtk.org.

* Soup

  You will need to build Soup, an HTTP transfer library, against glib2.
  Check out the soup-0-7 branch from the soup module in GNOME CVS.
  Configure it with the --enable-glib2 option, and install it into some
  funky prefix.  The library names aren't different between a glib 1.2
  build and a glib 2 build, so installing into a different prefix
  will ensure you don't accidentally overwrite an existing version!
  (Evolution uses Soup, for instance.)

* xmlrpc-c

  Get the xmlrpc-c 0.9.10 tarball from
  http://primates.ximian.com/~joe/xmlrpc-c and untar it.

  You'll need to apply a couple of patches to it; these patches have
  been sent upstream and will likely go into a 0.9.11 release if it
  ever happens.  The first (libxml2.patch) adds libxml2 backend support
  so we don't have to link against expat (we link against libxml2 already
  anyway).  The second (preinvoke.patch) adds preinvoke support, so we
  can do access control on methods.  Apply them both
  ("patch -p1 < [patch]" from the toplevel xmlrpc-c source dir).  Then
  engage in highly entertaining build fun:

      libtoolize --force --copy
      aclocal
      autoheader
      automake --gnu
      autoconf
      ./configure --prefix=/opt/rcd --enable-libxml2-backend \
         --disable-abyss-server --disable-cgi-server \
	 --disable-cplusplus --disable-libwww-client

And now you're ready to build RCD.

Building RCD, you will need to pass in some configure flags to enable
backends for your distro.  If you are on an RPM system, you'll want to
pass in:

  --enable-backend-rpm --enable-rpm-version=[version]

If you are on Debian:

  --enable-backend-dpkg

Since you should have installed Soup and xmlrpc-c in a weird prefix,
you will probably also want to use --with-xmlrpc-prefix=[prefix] and
--with-soup=[path].

Once all of that is taken care of, you should be off and running.
Good Luck.
