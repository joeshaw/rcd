.TH "rcd.config" "5" "1.0" "Ximian, Inc. 2002" "RCD Configuration File"
.SH "NAME"
rcd.conf \- RCD configuration file
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B rcd
uses a system-wide configuration file for setting various options
related to its operation.
.SH "CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT"
.LP
The configuration file is in the GNOME config file format, similar to
Windows .ini files.  Entries are grouped into sections.  A section
begins with the line
.LP
.I [Section]
.LP
and continues until the next section.  Entries in sections are
specified in key-value pairs, in the form:
.LP
.I entry=value
.LP
Neither
.I entry
nor
.I value
should be enclosed in double quotes.
.SH "SUPPORTED SECTIONS AND ENTRIES"
.LP
.B [Network]
.TP
This section contains settings for rcd's network options, including
what server to connect to, what proxy to use, and how many concurrent
downloads are permitted.

.TP
.B host=<url>
.br
This key specifies the server that rcd should connect to.  This is a
URL.  By default rcd contacts
.I http://red-carpet.ximian.com

.TP
.B enable-premium=[true | false]
.br
This key specifies whether the server is an enhanced server.  Set this
to true when connecting to a Red Carpet Express or Red Carpet
Corporate Connect server.  This defaults to false.

.TP
.B org_id=<organization id>
.br
When using an enhanced server, set this to the organization id so that
the daemon can register the machine with the server.  This is unset
and ignored by default; this key has no effect if
.B enable-premium
is not true.

.TP
.B proxy=<url>
.br
The URL for a proxy.  Valid protocols are "http", "https", "socks4",
and "socks5."  For example, if you're running squid on your local
machine, you'll want to set this to http://localhost:3128.  This is
unset and ignored by default.  This key can be set through rcd's
preferences mechanism.

.TP
.B proxy-username=<username>
.br
For proxies requiring authentication, this is the username used.
This is unset and ignored by default; this key has no effect if
.B proxy
is not set.  This key can be set through rcd's preferences mechanism.

.TP
.B proxy-password=<password>
.br
For proxies requiring authentication, this is the password used.
This is unset and ignored by default; this key has no effect if
.B proxy
is not set.  This key can be set through rcd's preferences mechanism.
.TP

.TP
.B http10=[true | false]
.br
This option determines whether or not rcd uses HTTP 1.0 or 1.1 to
connect to servers.  This setting may be helpful with some
uncooperative proxies.  This defaults to false.  This key can be set
through rcd's preferences mechanism.

.TP
.B max-downloads=<number>
.br
This option specifies how many concurrent package downloads rcd may
start.  Users on slower connections will want to decrease this,
whereas users with high bandwidth connections may want to increase
this.  If set to 0, there is no limit and rcd will make as many
connections as needed.  This defaults to 5.  This key can be set
through rcd's preferences mechanism.

.LP
.B [Cache]
.TP
This section contains settings related to rcd's download caches.

.TP
.B enabled=[true | false]
.br
Specifies whether rcd should cache downloaded data.  This defaults to
true.  This key can be set through rcd's preferences mechanism.

.TP
.B directory=<directory>
.br
Specifies the parent directory where rcd should store cached
downloaded data.  This defaults to /var/cache/redcarpet.  This key can
be set through rcd's preferences mechanism.

.TP
.B [System]
.br
This section contains settings related to rcd behavior.

.TP
.B heartbeat=<number>
.br
Specifies the interval at which rcd downloads new channel and package
metadata.  This defaults to 21600 (6 hours).  This key can be set
through rcd's preferences mechanism.

.TP
.B require-verified=[true | false]
.br
Specifies whether packages being installed must pass a GPG signature
check.  Packages which are inconclusive for whatever reason (gpg not
installed, public key unavailable, etc.) are not installed.
.I Not that rcd will never install packages in which a gpg signature
explicitly fails.
This defaults to false.  This key can be set through rcd's preferences
mechanism.

.TP
.B debug-level=<number>
.br
The level at which to log to standard error.  This can range
from 0 to 6, where 6 is extremely verbose.  This defaults to 4.  This
can be set through rcd's preferences mechanism.

.TP
.B syslog-level=<number>
.br
The level at which to log to syslog.  This can range from 0 to 6,
where 6 is extremely verbose.  This defaults to 4.  This can be set
through rcd's preferences mechanism.

.TP
.B cache-cleanup=[true | false]
.br
Specifies whether the package cache should be cleaned up.  If this is
off and caching is enabled, packages will accumulate in the cache
directory until it is cleared manually.  This defaults to true.  This
can be set through rcd's preferences mechanism.

.TP
.B cache-age-in-days=<number>
.br
Specifies the number of days a package may be in the cache before it
is removed.  This defaults to 30.  It has no effect if
.B cache-cleanup
is not set.  This can be set through rcd's preferences mechanism.

.TP
.B cache-size-in-mb=<number>
.br
Specifies the total size in megabytes that the package cache may be
before it is cleaned up.  This defaults to 300.  It has no effect if
.B cache-cleanup
is not set.  This can be set through rcd's preferences mechanism.
