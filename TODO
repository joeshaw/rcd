(Maybe further down the road...) Allow modules to register prefs

We need to add a fault to distinguish between an authentication
failure caused by a bad password and the user not having proper
privileges.  Right now a bad password results in the "You do not have
permissions to perform the requested action." error message in the
cmd-line client, which is confusing.

We are leaking all of the RCDPending objects that get created -- we
should have a mechanism for cleaning them up after task-completion
when a certain amount of time has passed

Need to be able to add users, remove users, set passwords, etc. via
the daemon.

Need docs and a man page.

Need to check through all the source files and check to make sure
the license is GPL v2 only.  (not "at your option, any later version")
