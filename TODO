Fix cache issue:
<joe> What I want to do is keep a separate cached copy of the last
known good XML file in /var/lib
<joe> So that it's actually separate from the cache and such, and have
the local files load from those if they can
<joe> I guess the problem would still remain, but it'd be much less
likely that people would go around deleting packageinfo.xml files from
that directory and not the channels.xml.gz

Need docs and a man page.
