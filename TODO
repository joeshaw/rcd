(Maybe further down the road...) Allow modules to register prefs

Compress the enormous XML spit out by rc_world_dump() before sending it
over the wire, and decompress it in the rc command-line client.

There should be a get_update_count (or whatever) method that returns
only the number of pending updates, possibly broken out by importance.
This way we can make a soothingly-throbbing update-alert panel applet
and not need to pass big chunks of data between it and the daemon.

We need to implement calls for "solvedeps", "whatprovides",
"whatrequires", etc. which take dependency dealies (package names,
shared libraries on RPM, etc.)

Need docs and a man page.
