Need to save/load prefs

(Maybe further down the road...) Allow modules to register prefs

We need to add code to XMLify the entire RCWorld, including all of the
channel package data and the subscriptions (this is really a
libredcarpet TODO, of course).  Then we need to add some XML-RPC glue
to pass that chunk of XML to the client for our 'debug' command.

There should be a XML-RPC method that does a graceful shutdown.  It should
probably only be allowed if it comes from root on the local machine.

Need docs and a man page.
