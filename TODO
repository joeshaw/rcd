(Maybe further down the road...) Allow modules to register prefs

Compress the enormous XML spit out by rc_world_dump() before sending it
over the wire, and decompress it in the rc command-line client.

Need to send more information down the wire when
installing/updating/removing about why certain packages are being
pulled in, removed, etc.

We need to implement calls for "solvedeps", "whatprovides",
"whatrequires", etc. which take dependency dealies (package names,
shared libraries on RPM, etc.)

Need to be able to add users, remove users, set passwords, etc. via
the daemon.

Need docs and a man page.
