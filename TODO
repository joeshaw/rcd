Need to save/load prefs

(Maybe further down the road...) Allow modules to register prefs

We need to add code to XMLify the entire RCWorld, including all of the
channel package data and the subscriptions (this is really a
libredcarpet TODO, of course).  Then we need to add some XML-RPC glue
to pass that chunk of XML to the client for our 'debug' command.

There should be a get_update_count (or whatever) method that returns
only the number of pending updates, possibly broken out by importance.
This way we can make a soothingly-throbbing update-alert panel applet
and not need to pass big chunks of data between it and the daemon.

Need docs and a man page.
