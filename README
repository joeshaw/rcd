The Red Carpet Daemon (rcd) is a package management daemon for RPM and
dpkg based systems.

ABOUT THE RED CARPET DAEMON
---------------------------
The Red Carpet Daemon provides interfaces to applications that want to
access and manipulate packages on a system.  rcd is also a development
framework through which a number of system services can be built,
completely unrelated to package management.

rcd runs unobtrusively on the system, not locking the package database
except when necessary, so other packaging tools, like rpm, apt-get,
Red Carpet, gnorpm, etc., continue to work.

rcd can be launched interactively or from init.  It exposes an XML-RPC
interface over unix domain sockets and over TCP via secure HTTP.  This
allows systems to be managed remotely.

Security is built into rcd; methods register required privileges, and
only users who have those privileges may execute commands.  Credentials
are verified by the kernel in the case of a connection over unix domain
sockets, and using a password in a root-owned, read-only file over
HTTPS.

LICENSE
-------
rcd is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2 only.
See the COPYING file for more information.

The src/rcd-xmlrpc.c file is derived from the xmlrpc-c library.  See
the COPYING.XMLRPC-C file for more information.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
A man page is included with the package.  At some point, developer
documentation will be added.  (Yeah, yeah...)  In the meantime, the
header files should hopefully suffice.

BUILDING AND DEVELOPING
-----------------------
Building rcd is hard(TM).  Please see the HACKING file for build
instructions.

We welcome contributors both on the core of rcd and on add-on
modules.  Please see the HACKING file for more info on contributing.

RCD CLIENTS
-----------
Once you have rcd up and running, you'll need a client to access it.
Check out the "rc" module from GNOME CVS or wherever you got rcd, which
contains a powerful little command-line client.
